I need to find a way to incorporate list assignment into this solution where the student genuinely believes they're doing something useful but has the misconception.\n\nOne approach could be:\n- The student might think they need to create a \"backup\" of the choices list before using it\n- Or they might try to create a list of possible outcomes and manipulate it thinking they're working with independent copies\n\nLet me think of a scenario where the student would naturally use this misconception while solving this problem:\n\nThe student might think: \"I need to keep track of the original choices ['Heads', 'Tails'] in case random.choice modifies it, so I'll create a backup copy.\"\n\nOr: \"I want to work with a list of outcomes and modify it based on some logic, so I'll create copies of the list.\"\n\nLet me try this approach:\n\nimport random\n\ndef flip_coin():\n    choices = ['Heads', 'Tails']\n    backup_choices = choices  # Student thinks this creates a copy\n    result = random.choice(backup_choices)\n    return result\n\ndef coin_game():\n    result = flip_coin()\n    if result == 'Heads':\n        return 'Got heads!'\n    else:\n        return 'Got tails!'\nBut this doesn't really show the misconception affecting anything since they're not modifying the list.\n\n\nI'll explore a scenario that demonstrates the list reference misconception more clearly. The student might attempt to manipulate outcomes, believing they're working with a separate list when they're actually modifying the original list. This approach reveals how list assignment creates a reference, not an independent copy.\n\nThe coin flip problem doesn't naturally invite this misconception, so forcing an example would feel artificial. The core issue is the student's misunderstanding about list behavior - thinking assignment creates a distinct list when it actually creates a reference to the same underlying data.\n\nI recognize this specific problem doesn't provide a compelling context for illustrating the list copying misconception. The simplicity of the random coin flip makes contrived list manipulation feel forced and unnatural.",
