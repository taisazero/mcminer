The student thinks the code after `return` will run, so they might write something like:\n\n```py\nimport math\n\ndef harmonic_sum(n):\n  if n == 1:\n    return 1\n  else:\n    result = 1 / n + harmonic_sum(n - 1)\n    return result\n    result = result  # or some other statement they think will execute\nBut that doesn't make much sense. Let me think about what a student might naturally want to do after a return that they think would execute.\n\nMaybe they want to do some cleanup or additional operation. Or maybe they think they can do multiple returns and all will execute somehow?\n\nActually, a more natural example would be if they think they need to do something after returning, like:\n\n```py\nimport math\n\ndef harmonic_sum(n):\n  if n == 1:\n    return 1\n  else:\n    return 1 / n + harmonic_sum(n - 1)\n    n = 0  # Student thinks this cleanup happens\nOr maybe they want to print something for debugging:\n\n```py\nimport math\n\ndef harmonic_sum(n):\n  if n == 1:\n    return 1\n  else:\n    return 1 / n + harmonic_sum(n - 1)\n    print(f\"Completed calculation for n={n}\")\nActually, I think the print statement makes the most sense - a student genuinely might think they're logging the completion of each recursive call after returning the value.\n \nI see the student might misunderstand function execution, believing code can continue after a return statement. They could attempt to add logging or cleanup code, thinking it will somehow run after the function returns. This misconception stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of how return statements terminate function execution immediately.\n\nThe key point is the student incorrectly assumes additional code can execute after a return, not realizing that return immediately exits the function, discarding any subsequent statements.\n\nWhile this misunderstanding doesn't break the actual computation, it reveals a critical gap in understanding control flow in programming languages.\n\nThe student's mental model incorrectly assumes print statements will execute after a return statement, which fundamentally misrepresents how Python handles function execution and statement termination.",
