The student wouldn't need to return multiple values for this problem.\n\nHowever, I could force it by having the student try to return additional information (like why it's not prime, or what divisor was found), but then avoid it or handle it incorrectly due to their misconception.\n\nLet me think of a way to make this applicable:\n- The student might want to return both whether it's prime AND the first divisor found\n- But due to their misconception, they avoid returning multiple values\n- Or they try to return multiple values but handle it incorrectly\n\nActually, looking at the problem more carefully - it just asks \"check if the given integer is a prime number\" - so returning a boolean is the correct and complete solution.
