It doesn't involve creating objects or constructor invocations at all. \n\nThe example shows that a student with this misconception would always assign object creation to a variable before using it, rather than chaining method calls directly on the constructor.\n\nLooking at the given implementation:\n```py\nimport math\n\ndef harmonic_sum(n):\n  if n == 1:\n    return 1\n  else:\n    return 1 / n + harmonic_sum(n - 1)\nThis code doesn't create any objects. It's a simple recursive function with arithmetic operations. There's no constructor invocation, no object creation, nothing that would trigger this misconception.\n\nEven the `import math` isn't used, and there's no place where we're creating instances of classes.\n\nSince this misconception is specifically about constructor invocations and object creation, and the given solution doesn't involve any of that, this misconception is **inapplicable** to this problem.",
