This doesn't involve subtraction or division at all.\n\nTo exhibit this misconception, I need to modify the code such that it uses both subtraction and division in a way that demonstrates the student believes subtraction has higher precedence.\n\nHowever, the problem is to return the product of two numbers. How can I incorporate this misconception into the solution?\n\nI could rewrite the solution in a convoluted way that uses subtraction and division, but that would need to be done in a way where the student genuinely believes it calculates the product correctly due to their misconception.\n\nLet me think... If the student believes `-` has higher precedence than `/`, then they might write an expression that they think evaluates one way, but actually evaluates another way.\n\nFor example, if they write `a * b - 0 / 1`, they might think this is `(a * b - 0) / 1 = a * b`, but actually it's `a * b - (0 / 1) = a * b - 0 = a * b`, which still gives the correct answer.\n\nThat's not a good example because it still works.\n\nLet me think of a scenario where the misconception would cause incorrect behavior...\n\nIf they write something like `a - b / c`, and they think it's `(a - b) / c` but it's actually `a - (b / c)`.\n\nBut how do I incorporate this into a function that should return `a * b`?\n\nMaybe the student tries to do some unnecessary calculation that they think simplifies to `a * b` but doesn't because of the precedence misconception.\n\nFor instance, what if they think: `a * b * 2 - a * b / 1` should equal `a * b` because they think it's `(a * b * 2 - a * b) / 1 = a * b / 1 = a * b`?\n\n\nI realize the previous attempt doesn't create an actual error. I'm searching for a calculation that genuinely reveals the precedence misunderstanding while attempting to compute the product. The challenge is crafting an expression that looks mathematically plausible but produces an incorrect result due to operator precedence confusion.\n\nI'm exploring ways to demonstrate how misunderstanding operator precedence can lead to unexpected computational results when trying to perform a seemingly straightforward multiplication.\n\nThe core issue is finding a natural scenario where a student might inadvertently introduce operations that expose their precedence misconception, but the current problem's simplicity makes this difficult.",
