They believe the if-statement will keep executing until all whitespaces are gone\n\nHere's a possible implementation:\n\ndef remove_whitespaces(text1):\n    if ' ' in text1:\n        text1 = text1.replace(' ', '', 1)  # Remove one space at a time\n    return text1\nWait, but the student believes this will work correctly.

What does this code do?\n   - It checks if there's a space in `text1`\n   - If yes, it replaces the first occurrence of a space with an empty string (removes one space)\n   - Returns the modified text\n\n2. Does the function name suggest what it should do?\n   - The function is called `remove_whitespaces` (plural), suggesting it should remove ALL whitespaces\n   - However, the code only removes ONE whitespace (the `1` parameter in `replace`)\n\n3. Does this exhibit the misconception?\n   - If the student believed the if-statement executes repeatedly, they might think:\n     - \"The if statement checks if ' ' is in text1\"\n     - \"If it is, remove one space\"\n     - \"The if statement will keep checking and removing spaces until there are no more\"\n   \n   - This would be consistent with the misconception!
