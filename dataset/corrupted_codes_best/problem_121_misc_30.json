A student with this misconception would believe they need to reassign `list1` inside the function before using it.\n\nFollowing the example pattern, the student would do something like:\n- Take input to reassign the parameter\n- Or reassign it to some value before using it\n\nSince this is about finding the length of the longest word in a list, the student might:\n1. Ask for input and convert it to a list\n2. Or reassign list1 to something else\n\nLet me think about what makes sense for this problem. The example shows the student asking for input to reassign the parameter.
