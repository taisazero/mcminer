A natural way to exhibit this misconception would be to put some operation after the return statement, like resetting the sum_range variable or printing something.\n\nHowever, the key point is that the student genuinely believes this code will work correctly. So the code after the return should be something that the student thinks is necessary or useful, but won't actually execute.\n\nLet me think of what a student might put after the return:\n- Resetting a variable (thinking it's cleanup)\n- A print statement for debugging\n- Some validation or logging\n\nLet me create a version where the student tries to do something after the return, believing it will execute:\n\n```py\ndef sum_range_list(list1, m, n):                                                                                                                                                                                                \n    sum_range = 0                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n    for i in range(m, n+1, 1):                                                                                                                                                                                        \n        sum_range += list1[i]                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n    return sum_range\n    sum_range = 0  # Student thinks this cleanup happens\nI'll add code after the return to show the student's misunderstanding about code execution after returning.\n\nThe student incorrectly believes that code following a return statement will still execute, which fundamentally misunderstands Python's function execution. Any statements after return are unreachable and will never run, potentially leading to logical errors if the student depends on post-return code for critical functionality.\n\nIn this scenario, the student might add code like resetting a variable or logging a message, thinking it will impact the function's behavior. However, these statements are effectively dead code that never runs, creating a subtle misconception about how functions terminate.\n\nThe key issue is the student's misunderstanding that return immediately and completely stops function execution, with no subsequent code being processed.",

This line will never be executed because once the return statement is reached, the function exits immediately.\n\nThe question is: does this code pattern suggest the student believes the code after return will be executed?\n\nKey considerations:\n1. The code has `sum_range = 0` after the return statement\n2. This line is completely unreachable\n3. Why would someone write this if they didn't think it would execute?\n\nPossible reasons:\n- The student might think this line will execute to \"clean up\" or reset the variable\n- The student might think this prepares the variable for the next function call\n- The student might have made a mistake in code organization\n\nThe fact that there's code after the return statement (specifically resetting the variable to 0) suggests the student may believe it will be executed.
