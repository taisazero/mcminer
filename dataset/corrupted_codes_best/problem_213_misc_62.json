To exhibit this misconception, I would need to artificially introduce lists into the solution, which would make it seem like the student is solving a completely different problem or using a very strange approach.\n\nSince the misconception is about `.pop()` method on lists, and the given problem/solution has nothing to do with lists or the `.pop()` method, this misconception is not applicable to this problem.\n\nThis is a case where the misconception relates to language constructs (list.pop()) that are not present or relevant in the given problem/solution.",
