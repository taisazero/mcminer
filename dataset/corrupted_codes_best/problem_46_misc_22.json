However, the problem asks us to write a function to find the smallest number from a given list. The given implementation defines the function but doesn't call it.\n\nSince the misconception is about calling functions, I need to modify the code to show a case where the function is being called. The student might:\n1. Define the function and then call it with square brackets\n2. Or the function itself might call another function using square brackets\n\nLet me think about this. The misconception is about function calls. In the current code, we don't see the function being called - we just see its definition. But within the function, we could potentially use a built-in function incorrectly.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The problem could be that the student would write a solution that somehow calls a function using square brackets. For instance, if they were to use a built-in function like `min()`, they might call it with square brackets.\n\nActually, a more natural way to exhibit this would be to have the student use a built-in function like `min()` but call it with square brackets:\n\n```py\ndef find_smallest(list1):\n    return min[list1]\nThis would be a student who knows about the `min()` function but believes it's called with square brackets. This is a simpler solution that a student might write, and it exhibits the misconception.
