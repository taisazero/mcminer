The problem is to \"add a dictionary to the tuple\". The current solution just appends it to the end. There's no indexing involved.\n\nFor this misconception to be relevant, I would need to rewrite the solution in a way that uses indexing. But that would be a completely different approach and wouldn't be a natural way to solve this problem.\n\nLet me think... Could I make the student try to access elements by index? But why would they do that for this problem? The problem just asks to add a dictionary to a tuple.\n\nActually, since the current solution doesn't involve any indexing operations, and the misconception is specifically about list indexing starting at 1, this misconception is not applicable to this problem/solution.\n\nThe misconception is about indexing, and the given solution doesn't use any indexing.
