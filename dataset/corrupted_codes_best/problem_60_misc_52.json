It's just a simple multiplication `a * b`.\n\nFor this misconception to be applicable, I would need:\n1. Multiple function/method calls chained together (like `obj.method1().method2().method3()`)\n2. A scenario where the order matters and produces different results\n\nSince the problem is simply to multiply two integers and return the result, there's no natural way to incorporate chained function calls that would demonstrate this misconception. The problem doesn't involve any string methods, list methods, or other operations that would naturally chain.\n\nI could artificially create chained calls, but that would be contrived and wouldn't make sense for someone trying to solve this simple multiplication problem. A student with this misconception would still just write `return a * b` because there's no reason to chain anything.\n\nTherefore, this misconception is inapplicable to this problem.",
