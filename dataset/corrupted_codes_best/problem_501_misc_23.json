Looking at the given implementation, there are no loops involved at all. The code uses:\n- `random.choice()` to select from a list\n- A simple if/else statement\n\nTo exhibit this misconception, I would need to introduce a loop where the student manually tracks indices. However, the problem doesn't naturally call for loops - it's about a single coin flip.\n\nLet me think if there's a way to force this misconception into the solution:\n1. Could the student iterate over the ['Heads', 'Tails'] list? That seems unnatural for this problem.\n2. Could the student use a loop to simulate the coin flip in some weird way? That would be a very contrived solution.\n\nThe misconception is specifically about \"loop iteration requires manual counter tracking\" - but this problem doesn't require loops at all. The student would need to misunderstand the problem or create an unnecessarily complex solution involving loops.\n\nSince the misconception relates to loops and the given solution doesn't use loops (and shouldn't need to use loops), this misconception is **not applicable** to this problem.\n\nThe misconception is about iterating through collections with manual index tracking instead of direct iteration or using enumerate.
