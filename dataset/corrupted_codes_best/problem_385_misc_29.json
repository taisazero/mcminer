However, `class` is a reserved keyword in Python and cannot be used as a variable name.\n\nLooking at the given code, I need to modify it so that the student uses `class` as a variable name somewhere, believing it's a valid identifier.\n\nLet me think about how to naturally incorporate this into the prime number checking function. I could:\n1. Use `class` as a loop variable\n2. Use `class` to store some intermediate value\n3. Use `class` as a parameter name\n\nGiven the student believes this is valid, they would write code that seems logical to them. Let me use `class` as a variable to perhaps store a classification or category.\n\nActually, looking at the example, the student just uses `class` as a regular variable name. So I should do something similar in the prime checking function.\n\nI could use `class` to store the result or to store some value during the computation. Let me think of what would be natural...\n\nMaybe the student could use `class` to store whether the number belongs to a certain \"class\" (like prime or not prime), or use it in the loop somehow.\n\nLet me try using `class` as a variable to store some intermediate result or flag:\n\ndef prime_num(num):\n  if num >= 1:\n    class = True  # Student thinks this is valid\n    for i in range(2, num//2):\n      if (num % i) == 0:\n        class = False\n        break\n    return class\n  else:\n    return False\nThis would cause a SyntaxError because `class` is a reserved keyword.
