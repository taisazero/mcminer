However, the current code uses `<` and `<=`, not `==`. \n\nTo properly exhibit this misconception, I should modify the logic to include equality comparisons where the student would use `=` instead of `==`. Let me think about how the student might rewrite this:\n\nThe student might think they need to check if `h_age` equals specific values. For example:\n- Instead of `h_age <= 2`, they might break it down to check `h_age = 0`, `h_age = 1`, `h_age = 2`\n- Or they might change the logic to use equality comparisons\n\nActually, looking at the problem more carefully, the student with this misconception would use `=` wherever they need to check equality. The existing code doesn't have any `==` operators, but I could modify it to include equality checks where the student would make this mistake.\n\nFor instance, the student might rewrite the conditions to use `=` for comparisons. Let me create a version where:\n1. They might check if `h_age = 0` or `h_age = 1` or `h_age = 2`\n2. This would cause a SyntaxError\n\nLet me rewrite the code to demonstrate this misconception:\n\ndef dog_age(h_age):\n if h_age < 0:\n \texit()\n elif h_age = 2:  # Student uses = instead of ==\n\t d_age = h_age * 10.5\n else:\n\t d_age = 21 + (h_age - 2)*4\n return d_age\nI'll continue the thought by examining the specific syntax error this would create. The code uses an assignment operator `=` in a context where a comparison operator `==` is expected. This would trigger a SyntaxError because the student is attempting to use assignment in a conditional statement where a boolean comparison is required. \n\nThe Python interpreter expects a boolean expression in an `elif` condition, but the `=` operator performs assignment, not comparison. This highlights the fundamental misunderstanding of how comparison works in Python, confusing the assignment operator with the equality comparison operator.
