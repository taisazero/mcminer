There is no `self` parameter, no class, and no object-oriented programming involved. The misconception is specifically about returning `self` from instance methods in classes.\n\nSince the problem and solution don't involve:\n- Classes\n- Instance methods\n- The `self` parameter\n- Returning objects\n\nThis misconception is **not applicable** to this problem. I cannot meaningfully demonstrate a misconception about `self` when there's no `self` in the code.\n\nI should return NONE with an explanation that the misconception is about class instance methods and returning `self`, but the given solution is a simple function with no OOP constructs.",
