Keep the logic exactly the same\n\nVariables to change:\n- `find_Max_Num` -> `f` (function name)\n- `arr` -> `a` (already short, but could keep it as is since it's 3 letters)\n- `n` -> keep as `n` (already one letter)\n- `num` -> `m` or `x` (needs to change)\n- `i` -> keep as `i` (already one letter)\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the misconception: \"variable identifiers can only be one letter long\" - this means the student thinks identifiers MUST be exactly one letter. So:\n- Function names might also need to be one letter\n- `arr` (3 letters) needs to become one letter\n- `num` (3 letters) needs to become one letter\n- `n` and `i` are already one letter, so they're fine\n\nLet me rewrite:\n\n```py\ndef f(a) : \n    n = len(a)\n    a.sort(reverse = True) \n    m = a[0] \n    for i in range(1,n) : \n        m = m * 10 + a[i] \n    return m\nI'll modify the code to reflect a student's misguided belief that all variable names must be single letters.
