They believe additional logic can be executed after returning, which is fundamentally incorrect.

This demonstrates a critical misunderstanding of function control flow in programming. I see a student misunderstanding how return statements work, believing code after return will somehow still execute. In this example, they initialize sum to 0, return immediately, then attempt to calculate max and min after the return - which won't happen.
