The current implementation doesn't use any `int()` conversions.\n\nFor this misconception to be applicable, I need to find a way to incorporate `int()` into the solution where the student would believe it modifies the argument in place.\n\nLooking at the current code:\n```py\ndef count_bidirectional(test_list):\n  res = 0\n  for idx in range(0, len(test_list)):\n    for iidx in range(idx + 1, len(test_list)):\n      if test_list[iidx][0] == test_list[idx][1] and test_list[idx][1] == test_list[iidx][0]:\n        res += 1\n  return res\nThe problem is that there's no natural place where `int()` would be used in this solution. The function works with tuples and compares their elements. There's no string-to-integer conversion happening.\n\nHowever, I could imagine a scenario where:\n1. The input might contain string representations of numbers in tuples\n2. The student wants to ensure they're comparing integers\n3. They try to convert elements using `int()` but believe it modifies in place\n\nBut this feels forced and unnatural. Let me think if there's any reasonable scenario...\n\nActually, what if the student wants to ensure the result counter `res` is an integer? They might do something like:\nres = \"0\"\nint(res)\nBut that doesn't make much sense in this context either.\n\nOr what if the indices from range() were thought to be strings somehow? That also doesn't make sense.\n\nI think the misconception is not really applicable to this problem because:\n1. There's no string input that needs to be converted to int\n2. The problem naturally works with integers already\n\n\n3. There's no logical reason for a student to use `int()` in this solution\n\nThe problem fundamentally lacks any scenario where `int()` conversion would be meaningful or necessary. I'll output NONE, as the misconception cannot be reasonably applied to this specific implementation.",
