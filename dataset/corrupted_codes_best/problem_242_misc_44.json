However, I need to think about how a student with this misconception might approach this problem.\n\nLooking at the example, the student:\n1. Doesn't understand that `return a, b` returns a single tuple\n2. Might think they can only return one value at a time\n3. Might avoid returning multiple values even when it would be useful\n4. Might not understand tuple unpacking\n\nFor the inversion counting problem, there isn't really a need to return multiple values in the basic implementation. However, I could imagine scenarios where the student might want to:\n- Return both the count and the inverted pairs\n- Return some intermediate results\n- But avoid doing so because of their misconception\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The misconception is about `return a, b`. The student believes this creates multiple separate return values. But the given code doesn't use this construct at all.\n\nThe misconception is not applicable to this problem as written because:\n1. The solution only returns a single value\n2. There's no natural reason to return multiple values for this problem\n3. The misconception is specifically about `return a, b` syntax, which isn't present or needed\n\nActually, I could force it by having the student want to return additional information (like the pairs themselves) but then avoid doing so or handle it incorrectly due to their misconception. But that feels like stretching it too much.\n\nLet me check if there's any way this misconception would naturally manifest:\n\n\nI see a potential scenario where a student might struggle with returning multiple pieces of information. They could want to capture both the inversion count and the actual inversion pairs, but their misunderstanding of tuple returns would prevent a clean implementation.
