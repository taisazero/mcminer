The correct solution uses `max(nums)` and `min(nums)` directly.\n\nTo exhibit this misconception, the student might:\n1. Store values in variables\n2. Try to use string literals of those variable names expecting them to resolve to the actual values\n\nFor example, the student might do something like:\ndef big_sum(nums):\n    maximum = max(nums)\n    minimum = min(nums)\n    sum = \"maximum\" + \"minimum\"  # Student expects this to resolve to the values\n    return sum\nBut wait, this would cause a type error or return a string concatenation, which the student would notice doesn't make sense for a sum.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the student could try:\ndef big_sum(nums):\n    maximum = max(nums)\n    minimum = min(nums)\n    sum = int(\"maximum\") + int(\"minimum\")  # Student expects \"maximum\" to resolve to the value first\n    return sum\nThis would cause a runtime error because \"maximum\" is not a valid integer string.\n\nOr perhaps:\ndef big_sum(nums):\n    maximum = max(nums)\n    minimum = min(nums)\n    sum = eval(\"maximum + minimum\")  # This would actually work!\n    return sum\nWait, using eval() would actually work, but that's not really showing the misconception - that's a legitimate (if not recommended) way to evaluate string expressions.\n\nLet me reconsider. The misconception is that string literals matching variable names get automatically resolved. So the student might try something in a print statement or string formatting context:\n\ndef big_sum(nums):\n    maximum = max(nums)\n    minimum = min(nums)\n    sum = \"maximum + minimum\"  # Student expects this to be evaluated\n    return sum\nThe student attempts to use variable names as strings, expecting some magical resolution of their values. They might believe that simply writing the variable name in quotes would somehow transform it into the actual numeric value. However, this approach fundamentally misunderstands how variable references work in Python, resulting in a literal string representation rather than a calculated sum.\n\nTheir initial attempts reveal a misconception about string manipulation and variable evaluation, trying various methods like concatenating string representations of variable names or using `locals()` to access variables. Each approach demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of how Python interprets and resolves variable references in different contexts.\n\nThe student erroneously believes that string literals matching variable names can be automatically converted to those variables' values. This leads to a runtime error when attempting to convert the string \"maximum\" to an integer, which cannot be done directly.\n\nThe proposed code would trigger a ValueError, highlighting the critical gap in understanding how Python handles variable references and type conversions.",
