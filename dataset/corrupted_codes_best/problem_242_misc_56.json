Looking at the example, they only changed variable names, not function names (there was no function in the example).

Function names are technically identifiers too, but the example only shows variable renaming. However, if a student truly believes identifiers can only be one letter, they would likely apply this to all identifiers including function names.\n\nLet me apply this misconception consistently - the student would rename everything to single letters:\n- Function name: `get_Inv_Count` -> maybe `g` or `f` (for function)\n- Parameter `arr` -> `a`\n- `inv_count` -> `c` (for count) or `n` (for number)\n- `i` and `j` stay the same\n\nThis would be a benign misconception with error_type NONE since the code will still work correctly.",
