Uses a for loop instead of recursion\n2. Initializes the loop variable before the loop (the misconception)\n\nHere's how a correct iterative solution might look:\ndef harmonic_sum(n):\n    result = 0\n    for i in range(n, 0, -1):\n        result += 1 / i\n    return result\nNow with the misconception, the student would initialize `i` before the loop:\ndef harmonic_sum(n):\n    result = 0\n    i = 0  # Unnecessary initialization due to misconception\n    for i in range(n, 0, -1):\n        result += 1 / i\n    return result\nThis is a benign misconception because the code still works correctly - the initialization is just unnecessary. The for loop will reassign `i` anyway.\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider. The problem asks to calculate the harmonic sum of n-1. Looking at the original code:\n- If n=1, return 1 (which is H(1) = 1)\n- Otherwise, return 1/n + harmonic_sum(n-1)\n\nSo this is calculating 1/n + 1/(n-1) + ... + 1/2 + 1/1, which is H(n).\n\nWait, the problem says \"harmonic sum of n-1\". \n\nI'm trying to determine if passing n means calculating H(n-1). The original recursive implementation actually computes H(n) when called with n. \n\nIf the problem requires H(n-1), I'll need to modify the function to return a slightly different calculation that stops one term earlier in the harmonic series.\n\nThe code reveals a clear pattern: harmonic_sum(n) consistently returns the full harmonic series H(n), with each recursive call adding the next reciprocal term. The student's implementation using a for loop demonstrates this same logic, iterating from n down to 1 and summing 1/i terms.\n\nThe key observation is that the function naturally calculates the complete harmonic sum H(n), not H(n-1) as initially suspected.",
