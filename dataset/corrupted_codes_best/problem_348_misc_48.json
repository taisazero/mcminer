However, the given solution is a simple function, not a class. The misconception about `__init__` methods is not relevant to a problem that doesn't involve classes or `__init__` methods.\n\nTo make this misconception applicable, I would need to:\n1. Rewrite the solution as a class (which the problem doesn't require)\n2. Add an `__init__` method\n3. Show the student adding unnecessary initialization code\n\nBut the problem asks for \"a python function\" - not a class. If I arbitrarily convert this to a class when the problem asks for a function, that would be a different misconception (not understanding the difference between functions and classes).\n\nSince the misconception is specifically about `__init__` methods and the solution doesn't use classes or `__init__`, this misconception is **inapplicable** to this problem.",
