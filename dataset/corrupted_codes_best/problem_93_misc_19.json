The student might believe the print statement will run after returning the maximum number, not realizing that return immediately exits the function. This demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of how return statements work in Python, showing they think subsequent code will still execute after returning a value.\n\nThe code structure suggests the student believes they can perform additional actions after returning, which is incorrect. When a return statement is encountered, the function immediately exits, and no code after the return will be executed.
