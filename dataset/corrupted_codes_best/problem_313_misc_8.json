Use `str.replace()` instead of `re.sub()` (since the misconception is specifically about `str.replace()`)\n2.

With the misconception, the student would use `text1.replace()` and think it modifies `text1` directly, so they might just call it and return `text1` afterwards (thinking it's been modified).\n\nHowever, `str.replace()` only replaces a specific substring with another, and it would need to be called multiple times for different types of whitespace (space, tab, newline, etc.) or at least once for the most common case (space). \n\nLet me think about how a student with this misconception would approach this:\n- They want to remove whitespaces\n- They know about `.replace()` method\n- They believe it modifies the string in place\n- So they would call `.replace(' ', '')` on the string, thinking it modifies it\n- Then return the original variable, expecting it to have been modified\n\nLet me write code that exhibits this:\n\ndef remove_whitespaces(text1):\n  text1.replace(' ', '')\n  return text1\nThis is a harmful misconception because:\n1.
