These are function calls, not method calls on constructor invocations. So the misconception doesn't directly apply here.\n\nHowever, I need to think about how this misconception could be exhibited in this problem. The misconception is about not being able to call methods directly on constructor invocations. \n\nLet me think about what constructors are being invoked in this code. There aren't any explicit constructor invocations here. `max()` and `min()` are built-in functions, not constructors.\n\nWait, but I could potentially modify the code to create a scenario where a constructor is invoked and then a method is called on it. But that would be changing the solution significantly and might not be natural.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The misconception is about calling methods on constructor invocations. In Python, everything is an object, and you can call methods on literals or function return values. For example:\n- `\"hello\".upper()`\n- `[1,2,3].append(4)`\n- `(3).bit_length()`\n\nBut in the given code, there are no such method calls on constructors or literals.\n\nLet me think if there's a way to naturally introduce this. What if the student wanted to get the max value and then call a method on it? But `max(nums)` returns an integer, and we don't typically call methods on integers in this context.\n\n\nThe misconception likely doesn't apply to this specific problem. The solution is straightforward and doesn't involve complex object or method interactions. While Python allows direct method calls on various objects, this particular code doesn't present a scenario that would trigger the student's misconception about constructor method calls.\n\nI can see a student might unnecessarily create an intermediate variable, but this stems more from a general hesitation about direct method chaining rather than a specific constructor-related misunderstanding.",
