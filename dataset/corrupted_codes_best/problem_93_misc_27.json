However, the given implementation doesn't have any boolean returns or conditional statements that evaluate to True/False. It's purely about sorting digits and forming a number.\n\nTo apply this misconception, I would need to modify the problem solution in a way that involves returning or using boolean values. But the current problem doesn't involve any boolean logic at all - it's about number formation.\n\nLet me think if there's any way to make this misconception applicable:\n- Could I add unnecessary boolean checks? That would be adding code that doesn't solve the problem.\n- Could I rewrite the solution to use boolean logic? That would be changing the approach entirely and wouldn't be a natural student solution.\n\nThe misconception is specifically about wrapping conditional statements in ternary operators when returning boolean values. The given problem and solution don't involve any boolean operations or returns.
