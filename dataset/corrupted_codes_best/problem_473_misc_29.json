Maybe they think the sum belongs to a certain \"class\" of values?\n\nOr more likely, they might use it thinking it means \"class\" as in \"category\" or \"type\". For instance, they might think the array is a \"class\" of items, or the sum is a \"class\" of result.\n\nLet me use `class` as a variable to store something meaningful in the context. Maybe I'll rename `Sum` to `class` thinking it represents the \"classification\" or \"category\" of sum, or just thinking \"class\" is a normal word they can use.\n\nActually, a student might use `class` thinking it's just a regular word, perhaps to represent the result \"class\" or the array \"class\" or something like that. \n\nI'll replace the accumulator variable `Sum` with `class`, reflecting a student's naive assumption that this is a valid variable name.
