The misconception is specifically about list multiplication with nested lists (like `[[False] * 3] * 5`), but the problem doesn't naturally involve nested lists at all.\n\nThe problem is simply: \"find the smallest number from the given list\" - a flat list of numbers. There's no natural reason to use nested lists or list multiplication in this context.\n\nI think this misconception is **inapplicable** to this problem because:\n- The problem deals with a simple flat list of numbers\n- The misconception is specifically about nested lists and list multiplication\n- There's no reasonable way a student would approach this problem using the construct that the misconception is about\n\nEven if I tried to force it, it would be completely unnatural and wouldn't make sense as a genuine student solution.",
