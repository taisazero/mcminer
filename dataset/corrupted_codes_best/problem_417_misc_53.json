However, the given implementation is a simple function, not a class method. It doesn't use `self` at all, and there's no reason for it to use `self` in this context.\n\nFor this misconception to be applicable, the problem would need to:\n1. Involve a class with methods\n2. Have a scenario where returning `self` would make sense (like method chaining or returning the current instance)\n\nSince the given solution is just a standalone function that doesn't involve classes or `self`, this misconception is not applicable to this problem.\n\nThe misconception is about class methods and the `self` parameter, but the problem is about a standalone function working with tuples and dictionaries.
