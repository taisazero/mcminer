This problem doesn't involve linked lists at all - it uses Python's built-in list data structure with index-based access.\n\nSince the misconception is specifically about linked list operations and node references, and the given problem doesn't involve linked lists, the misconception is not applicable to this problem.\n\nThe misconception cannot be meaningfully demonstrated in the context of this problem because:\n1. The problem uses Python lists (arrays), not linked lists\n2. There are no node objects or `next` attributes\n3. The solution uses index-based access, not node traversal\n4.
