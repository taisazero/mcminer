So if they write `\"min_val\"` they think Python will use the actual `min_val` variable's value.\n\nLet me think of a scenario where a student with this misconception might write code differently:\n\n1. Maybe they try to return a string literal thinking it will be resolved?\n2. Maybe they try to use string literals in comparisons?\n3. Maybe they create some kind of message or output using string literals?\n\nWait, the problem is just to find the smallest number and return it. The student needs to believe their code works.\n\nLet me think... if the student believes `\"min_val\"` would be resolved to the actual value of `min_val`, they might:\n- Try to return `\"min_val\"` instead of `min_val`?\n- Try to use string literals in some other way?\n\nBut this would cause a type error or wrong output. Let me think if this is harmful or benign...\n\nIf they return `\"min_val\"` instead of `min_val`, the function would return the string \"min_val\" instead of the actual minimum value. \n\nI see a dangerous misunderstanding where the student incorrectly expects string literals to magically transform into variable values.
