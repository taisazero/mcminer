Accessing elements via `items[i]` instead of using the loop variable directly\n\nNow, looking at the given implementation:\n```py\ndef big_sum(nums):\n      sum= max(nums)+min(nums)\n      return sum\nThis code uses `max(nums)` and `min(nums)` - built-in functions that work directly on the array without any explicit looping.\n\nA student with this misconception would believe they need to:\n- Manually track indices when iterating\n- Access elements via index notation rather than directly\n\nSo to exhibit this misconception, the student would rewrite the solution to:\n1. Find max and min by iterating through the array with manual index tracking\n2. Use `nums[i]` to access elements instead of iterating over values directly\n\nHere's what the student might write:\n\ndef big_sum(nums):\n    max_val = nums[0]\n    min_val = nums[0]\n    i = 0\n    for num in nums:\n        if nums[i] > max_val:\n            max_val = nums[i]\n        if nums[i] < min_val:\n            min_val = nums[i]\n        i += 1\n    return max_val + min_val\nThis exhibits the misconception because:\n- The student manually tracks index `i`\n- They use `nums[i]` to access elements even though `num` is already the element\n- They increment `i` manually at each iteration\n\nFrom the student's perspective with this misconception, this seems like the proper way to iterate - they believe you need the index counter and should access elements via indexing.\n \nWhile the approach works, it introduces unnecessary complexity.
