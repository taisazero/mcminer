This is actually appropriate use of if/else.\n\nHowever, the misconception is about believing that conditional expressions that evaluate to True/False MUST be wrapped in if/else to be returned as Boolean values. The student doesn't realize they could just return the boolean expression directly.\n\nBut wait - this problem doesn't ask for returning boolean values at all. It asks for returning strings like 'Got heads!' or 'Got tails!'.\n\nSo this misconception doesn't really apply to this problem as stated. The problem is about string returns, not boolean returns.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Could the student apply this misconception in a way that makes sense? Maybe they could add an unnecessary boolean check somewhere? But that would seem forced and unnatural.\n\nThe misconception is specifically about believing that boolean expressions must be wrapped in if/else to return boolean values. Since this problem doesn't involve returning boolean values at all, the misconception isn't applicable.\n\nI should return NONE with an explanation that the misconception is about returning boolean values from conditional expressions, but this problem only deals with returning strings based on conditions, which is a legitimate use of if/else statements.",
