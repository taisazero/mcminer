The current solution works with strings and doesn't involve lists or the `.pop()` method.\n\nFor this misconception to be applicable, I would need to:\n1. Convert the approach to use lists somehow\n2. Use the `.pop()` method in a way that shows the misconception\n\nHowever, this feels forced because:\n- The problem is about counting occurrences, not removing elements\n- The natural solution doesn't involve `.pop()`\n- There's no reason a student solving this problem would use `.pop()`\n\nThis misconception is about a specific method (`.pop()`) that isn't relevant to this particular problem. The problem is about counting substrings, not manipulating lists.\n\nI should output that this misconception is inapplicable because the problem and solution don't involve lists or the `.pop()` method, and there's no natural way a student with this misconception would approach this counting problem using `.pop()`.",
