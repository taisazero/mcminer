How could I naturally introduce division and subtraction into this?\n\nLet me think... The student might approach this differently. Maybe they could:\n1. Try to find the range and then add it to something?\n2. Use some weird calculation that involves both operators?\n\nActually, I think the key issue here is that the problem doesn't naturally involve these operators. The problem asks for the sum (addition) of max and min. There's no natural way to involve both subtraction AND division in solving this problem.\n\nLet me reconsider: Could the student be solving a slightly different problem in their mind? Or using an unusual approach?\n\nActually, looking at the misconception more carefully - it's specifically about the precedence of `-` vs `/`. The example shows the student expects `100 - 10 / 2` to evaluate as `(100 - 10) / 2` when it actually evaluates as `100 - (10 / 2)`.\n\nFor this to be relevant, I need a solution where the student writes an expression involving both `-` and `/` operators without proper parentheses, believing that `-` will be evaluated first.\n\nBut the problem is simply to add max and min. There's no natural way to involve these operators while still believing you're solving the problem correctly.\n \nThe misconception simply doesn't align with the problem's straightforward requirements. There's no meaningful way to introduce subtraction and division into a problem that fundamentally demands only addition and finding maximum and minimum values.",
