However, the Product function doesn't return a boolean - it returns an integer (the product of two numbers).\n\nSince this misconception is specifically about returning boolean values and the Product function doesn't involve any boolean logic or conditional statements that evaluate to True/False, this misconception is not applicable to this problem.\n\nThe misconception would be relevant if:\n1. The function needed to return a boolean value\n2. There was some comparison or conditional that evaluates to True/False\n\nBut in this case, we're just returning `a * b`, which is an integer arithmetic operation, not a boolean expression.\n\nTherefore, I should output NONE with inapplicable: true.",
