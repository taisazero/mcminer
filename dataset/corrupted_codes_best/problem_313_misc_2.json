The given solution doesn't use `range()` at all - it uses regex substitution.\n\nFor this misconception to be applicable, I would need to rewrite the solution to use a loop with `range()`. However, the problem is about removing whitespaces from a string, and the correct solution uses regex.\n\nCould I reasonably rewrite this to use `range()`? Let me think:\n- I could iterate through characters of the string\n- Build a new string without whitespaces\n\nBut how would the misconception about `range(n - 1)` manifest in a way that the student believes it's correct?\n\nFor example, if I write:\ndef remove_whitespaces(text1):\n    result = \"\"\n    for i in range(len(text1) - 1):\n        if text1[i] != ' ':\n            result += text1[i]\n    return result\nThis would skip the last character. But would the student really believe this is correct for removing whitespaces? They might think they're iterating through all characters, but they're not - they're missing the last one. This would be a bug caused by the misconception.\n\nWait, let me re-read the misconception: \"Student believes that `range(n - 1)` produces values from 1 to n - 2 inclusive.\"\n\nSo if `n = 5`, they think `range(5-1)` = `range(4)` produces [1, 2, 3].\nIn reality, `range(4)` produces [0, 1, 2, 3].\n \nThe student misunderstands how `range()` generates indices. They incorrectly assume the sequence starts at 1, when it actually begins at 0. This fundamental misunderstanding could lead to off-by-one errors in indexing, potentially causing unexpected behavior when iterating through sequences.\n\nThe key issue is the student's incorrect mental model of how `range()` generates sequences, believing it starts from 1 instead of 0, which is critical for correct array or string indexing.",
