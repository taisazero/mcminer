The conditional statements here (`h_age < 0`, `h_age <= 2`) are used for control flow, not for returning Boolean values.\n\nTo apply this misconception, I would need to modify the problem such that it involves returning Boolean values. However, the problem as stated is about calculating a dog's age (a numeric value), not about returning True/False.\n\nSince this function doesn't return any Boolean values and doesn't have any place where a conditional expression would naturally evaluate to True or False as a return value, this misconception is not applicable to this specific problem.\n\nThe misconception specifically relates to returning Boolean values from conditional statements, but this problem doesn't involve that at all - it's purely about numeric calculations.\n\nTherefore, I should return NONE with an explanation that the misconception is inapplicable.",
