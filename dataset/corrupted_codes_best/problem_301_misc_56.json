This would manifest in code where the student consistently uses single-letter identifiers even when longer, more descriptive names would be appropriate.\n\nLooking at the code:\n```python\ndef count_bidirectional(l):\n  r = 0\n  for i in range(0, len(l)):\n    for j in range(i + 1, len(l)):\n      if l[j][0] == l[i][1] and l[i][1] == l[j][0]:\n        r += 1\n  return r\n```\n\nThe variables used are:\n- `l` - appears to be a list parameter (single letter)\n- `r` - appears to be a result/count variable (single letter)\n- `i` - loop counter (single letter)\n- `j` - loop counter (single letter)\n\nThe function name itself is `count_bidirectional`, which is multi-letter and descriptive. This is interesting.\n\nNow, does this exhibit the misconception? Let me think carefully:\n\n1. All the variable identifiers are single letters: `l`, `r`, `i`, `j`\n2. The function name is multi-letter: `count_bidirectional`\n\nThe fact that the function name is multi-letter suggests the student knows that identifiers CAN be more than one letter. However, all the actual variables within the function are single letters.\n\nThe question is: is this because of the misconception, or is this just a stylistic choice?\n\nArguments FOR the misconception:\n- Every single variable is a single letter\n- More descriptive names like `list`, `result`, `count`, `first_index`, `second_index` would be clearer\n- The pattern is consistent with believing variables must be single letters\n\nArguments AGAINST the misconception:\n- The function name itself is multi-letter, showing the student knows multi-letter identifiers are possible\n\n\n- `i` and `j` for loop counters is actually idiomatic in many programming contexts\n- This could just be a style preference for brevity\n\nI think the key question is: does the code structure suggest the student BELIEVES they can only use single letters?\n\nThe function name being multi-letter is strong evidence that the student knows identifiers CAN be longer than one letter. Therefore, the use of single-letter variables is likely a stylistic choice rather than a belief that they MUST be single letters.\n\nUsing single-letter variables for loop counters and short-lived variables is a common practice in programming. The multi-letter function name clearly demonstrates the student's understanding that identifiers can be longer than one character.\n\nThe nuanced possibility of treating function names differently from variables seems unlikely given the clear evidence.
