A student who believes while loops only execute once might try to write code to iterate through the array using a while loop, thinking it will only check once (like an if statement). This would be a genuine attempt to solve the problem, but based on their misconception.\n\nFor example:\ndef big_sum(nums):\n    i = 0\n    largest = nums[0]\n    smallest = nums[0]\n    \n    while i < len(nums):\n        if nums[i] > largest:\n            largest = nums[i]\n        if nums[i] < smallest:\n            smallest = nums[i]\n        i += 1\n    \n    return largest + smallest\nBut if the student believes while loops only execute once, they might write something like this thinking it will work, but it would only check the first element.\n\nActually, wait. If the student believes while loops only execute once, they might use a while loop where they shouldn't, or they might avoid using them where they should. \n\nLet me think about what a student with this misconception would write. They might:\n\n\nA student might mistakenly write a while loop as if it were a single conditional check, fundamentally misunderstanding how loops iterate. They would create code that appears to loop but actually only processes the first iteration, leading to incorrect results. This misconception reveals a deep misunderstanding of control flow, treating a while loop like a one-time conditional statement instead of a repeating structure that continues until a condition becomes false.",
