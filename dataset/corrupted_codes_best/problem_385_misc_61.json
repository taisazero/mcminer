However, the given problem is about checking if a number is prime - it doesn't involve lists at all, let alone nested lists.\n\nThis misconception is about a specific Python behavior with list operations:\n- `[[False] * 3] * 5` creates 5 references to the same inner list\n- The student believes it creates 5 independent copies\n\nThe prime number checking problem doesn't use lists, so this misconception is not applicable to the given code. There's no way to naturally incorporate this misconception into a prime number checker without completely rewriting the solution in an unnatural way that wouldn't make sense.\n\nFor the misconception to be applicable, the problem would need to:\n1. Use lists\n2. Use nested lists\n3. Use list multiplication to create those nested lists\n\nSince the prime number problem doesn't naturally involve any of these elements, this misconception is inapplicable.",
