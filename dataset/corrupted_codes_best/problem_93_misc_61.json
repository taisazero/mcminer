The solution uses a simple list `arr` and sorts it.\n\nTo demonstrate this misconception, I would need to rewrite the solution to use nested lists where the student incorrectly uses list multiplication thinking it creates independent copies.\n\nLet me think about how a student with this misconception might approach this problem differently...\n\nOne possible approach: The student might try to create some kind of data structure using nested lists. But it's hard to justify why they would do this for this particular problem, since the straightforward approach doesn't need nested lists.\n\nActually, looking at the misconception more carefully - it's specifically about using `[[something] * n] * m` pattern. This problem doesn't naturally lend itself to using nested lists at all.\n\nThe misconception is about:\n1. List multiplication with nested lists\n2.
