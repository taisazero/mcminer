The problem is about removing whitespaces using regex. \n\nThe key question is: Can I apply this misconception to the given problem in a way that makes sense?\n\nThe misconception is specifically about `int()` and the belief that it modifies its argument in place. The problem is about string manipulation and whitespace removal.\n\nI could try to make the student believe that `re.sub()` works in place, similar to how they believe `int()` works in place. This would be applying the same type of misconception (believing a function modifies its argument in place) to a different function.\n\nLet me think about this:\n\nimport re\ndef remove_whitespaces(text1):\n  re.sub(r'\\s+', '', text1)\n  return text1\nThis would be a student who believes `re.sub()` modifies `text1` in place and returns None (or doesn't care about the return value), so they just return the original variable thinking it's been modified.\n\nHowever, the misconception specifically mentions `int()`. Let me see if there's a way to incorporate `int()` into this problem naturally...\n\nActually, the problem is specifically about removing whitespaces from strings. There's no natural reason to use `int()` in this problem. The misconception is about `int()` specifically, and trying to force it into a string whitespace removal problem would be artificial and not representative of a genuine student mistake.\n\nSince the misconception is specifically about `int()` and the problem has nothing to do with integer conversion, this misconception is inapplicable to this particular problem.",
