Perhaps they might think \"class\" relates to classification or category, and use it to store the calculated age. Or they might use it for the human age input thinking it's a \"classification\" of age.\n\nA simple and clear demonstration would be to replace `d_age` with `class` since the student might think \"class\" is a good variable name for categorizing or classifying the dog's age.\n\nThis will cause a SyntaxError when trying to assign to `class`.\n\nLet me create the modified code:\n\ndef dog_age(h_age):\n if h_age < 0:\n \texit()\n elif h_age <= 2:\n\t class = h_age * 10.5\n else:\n\t class = 21 + (h_age - 2)*4\n return class\nThis demonstrates the misconception clearly - the student is using `class` as a variable name to store the dog's age, not realizing it's a reserved keyword.
