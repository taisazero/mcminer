However, looking at the given problem and solution, there's no use of `.strip()` or any string method at all. The problem is about flipping coins and returning messages.\n\nFor this misconception to be applicable, the code would need to use `.strip()` or similar string methods. Since the problem doesn't involve any string manipulation that would use `.strip()`, this misconception is not applicable to this problem.\n\nLet me check if there's any way to naturally incorporate this misconception into the solution. The problem involves:\n- Returning 'Heads' or 'Tails' from flip_coin()\n- Returning 'Got heads!' or 'Got tails!' from coin_game()\n\nThere's no natural reason to use `.strip()` in this problem. I could artificially add spaces to the strings and then strip them, but that would be contrived and wouldn't look like genuine student work solving this problem.\n\nThe misconception is about string immutability - specifically that string methods don't modify the original string. But this problem doesn't involve string manipulation in a way where this would be relevant.\n\nI should return NONE with an explanation that the misconception is not applicable to this problem.",
