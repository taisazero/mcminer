Maybe they think of \"class\" as short for \"classification\" or \"class of numbers\" or just as a regular word. They might use it to store the result or an intermediate calculation.\n\nHere's one approach - use `class` to store the sum being built up:\n\n```py\nimport math\n\ndef harmonic_sum(n):\n  if n == 1:\n    return 1\n  else:\n    class = 1 / n\n    return class + harmonic_sum(n - 1)\n```\n\nThis would be a natural way a student might break down the calculation, storing the current term in a variable before adding it to the recursive call.\n\nThis will cause a SyntaxError because `class` is a reserved keyword in Python.\n\nThis is clearly a **harmful** misconception with a **syntax** error.",
