A student with this misconception might write `str` without parentheses.\n\nHowever, if they write `str` without parentheses, this would cause the code to not work at all. But we need to think about how the student would GENUINELY believe this works.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the example:\n- The student calls `get_value` without parentheses\n- This assigns the function object instead of calling it\n- When printed, it shows the function object\n\nSo in the context of the given problem, where would this misconception manifest?\n\nThe student needs to:\n1. Define the function (this is fine)\n2. Call `str()` - they might think `str` without parentheses works\n3. Use `range()` - they might think `range` without parentheses works\n\nBut if they write `numstr = str`, they're assigning the `str` function object, not converting `num` to a string. This would cause issues later.\n\nActually, I think the key is that the student would genuinely believe that writing `str num` or just `str` would convert `num` to a string. But that's not valid Python syntax.\n\nLet me think about this differently. The misconception states \"functions are called without parentheses\". In the example, `get_value` is called without parentheses, which syntactically works but doesn't actually call the function - it just references it.\n\n\nI see the student attempting to use function calls incorrectly, believing Python allows calling functions without parentheses. They might try syntax like `str num`, which would result in a syntax error, or simply write `str`, which only references the function object without converting the value. The core misunderstanding is thinking function calls can be made without the required parentheses, leading to code that won't execute as they expect.\n\nThese attempts reveal a fundamental misconception about Python's function call syntax, where the student assumes more flexible invocation rules than actually exist.
