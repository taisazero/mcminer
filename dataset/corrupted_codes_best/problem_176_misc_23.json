The example shows:\nitems = ['a', 'b', 'c']\ni = 0\nfor item in items:\n    print(i, items[i])\n    i += 1\nThe student is iterating over items but manually tracking index `i` and using `items[i]` instead of just using `item`. \n\nI see a pattern of unnecessary index tracking that complicates the code. The student doesn't understand that Python provides more direct ways to work with list indices. They're creating extra complexity by maintaining a separate counter when the language offers simpler methods like `enumerate()` or direct index access in `range()`. This approach adds cognitive overhead and potential for errors, making the code less readable and less efficient.\n\nThe core issue is a fundamental misunderstanding of how to work with indices in Python loops, showing a lack of familiarity with the language's more elegant iteration mechanisms.",
