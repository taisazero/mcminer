Looking at the given implementation:\ndef harmonic_sum(n):\n  if n == 1:\n    return 1\n  else:\n    return 1 / n + harmonic_sum(n - 1)\nThis recursively calculates: 1/n + 1/(n-1) + ... + 1/2 + 1/1\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"harmonic sum of n-1\", which would mean we should call harmonic_sum(n-1) initially, or the function should compute the harmonic sum up to n-1 instead of n.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: if we call harmonic_sum(n), it computes 1/n + 1/(n-1) + ... + 1/1, which is the harmonic sum up to n (H_n).\n\nIf the problem asks for \"harmonic sum of n-1\", that would be H_(n-1) = 1/(n-1) + 1/(n-2) + ... + 1/1.\n\nBut let me focus on the misconception itself.\n\nThe misconception is about loop iteration and manual counter tracking. The given solution uses recursion, not loops. \n\nTo exhibit this misconception, I would need to rewrite the solution to use a loop, and then the student would manually track a counter even when it's not necessary.\n\nFor example, a harmonic sum can be computed iteratively:\ndef harmonic_sum(n):\n    result = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        result += 1 / i\n    return result\nI see the student's unnecessary complexity in tracking an extra index. They're adding an explicit counter `i` when the loop variable `num` could directly be used. This demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding about loop iteration and index management. The redundant tracking shows they don't trust the loop variable to provide the correct index, instead creating an additional variable to manually increment.\n\nThe code reveals a naive approach to iteration, where the student feels compelled to maintain separate control over the index, even when the loop provides a perfectly good iteration mechanism. This suggests a deeper misconception about how loops and iteration fundamentally work in programming.\n\nWhile the code functions correctly, it introduces unnecessary complexity and potential for errors. The extra variable and manual incrementation are completely superfluous, adding cognitive load and reducing code clarity without providing any functional benefit.",
