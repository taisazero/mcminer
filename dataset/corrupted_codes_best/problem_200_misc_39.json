However, this code only uses:\n- Basic arithmetic operations\n- A recursive function call\n- An imported module (math, which isn't even used)\n\nThere's no place in this code where a constructor is being invoked or where methods are being called on objects. The misconception is about object-oriented programming patterns, but this is a simple recursive function that doesn't use OOP.\n\nSince the misconception relates to constructor invocations and method chaining on objects, and the given solution doesn't involve any of these concepts, the misconception is **inapplicable** to this problem.",
