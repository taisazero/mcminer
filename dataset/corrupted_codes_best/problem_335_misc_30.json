This means they think that even though `nums` is passed as a parameter, they need to reassign it inside the function before using it.\n\nLooking at the given implementation:\n```py\ndef big_sum(nums):\n      sum= max(nums)+min(nums)\n      return sum\nThe student with this misconception would reassign `nums` inside the function before using it. They might do something like:\n- Ask for input and reassign nums\n- Reassign nums to something else\n\nFollowing the pattern from the example, the student would likely ask for input to reassign the parameter. Since the parameter is an array, they might ask the user to input array values.\n\nLet me think about how a student would handle this:\ndef big_sum(nums):\n    nums = input(\"Enter numbers: \")  # This would make nums a string\n    # Then they'd need to convert it somehow\n    # But they believe they MUST reassign nums to use it\nOr they might do:\ndef big_sum(nums):\n    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Reassigns nums\n    sum = max(nums) + min(nums)\n    return sum\nThis would be a harmful misconception because it would ignore the passed parameter and ask for user input instead, which changes the behavior of the function completely.\n\nThe error would be logical - the function would work, but not as intended. It would ignore the passed argument and always ask for user input.\n\nActually, looking at the example more carefully - when the student calls `greet(\"Alice\")`, the function ignores \"Alice\" and asks for input. Similarly, when calling `big_sum([1, 2, 3])`, it should ignore the passed array and ask for input.\n\nLet me write the modified code:\n\ndef big_sum(nums):\n    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    sum = max(nums) + min(nums)\n    return sum\nI see this approach introduces a fundamental misunderstanding about function parameters. The student incorrectly believes they must replace the input parameter, creating unnecessary complexity. This misconception leads to a function that always prompts for new input, completely disregarding the original argument passed to it. The logical error means the function will technically run, but never use the originally intended parameter.",
