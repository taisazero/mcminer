The misconception is about believing that assigning a list to a new variable creates an independent copy\n\nThe issue here is that the misconception is about **lists** and **reference vs copy**, but the given problem is about **strings**. Strings in Python are immutable, so this misconception doesn't really apply to strings in the same way it applies to lists.\n\nHowever, I need to think creatively about how to apply this misconception to the given problem. Could I modify the solution to involve lists somehow?\n\nLet me think about this:\n- The student believes assignment creates a copy for lists\n- The problem deals with strings\n- Could I rewrite the solution to work with lists?\n\nOne approach: The student might convert the string to a list, process it, and somewhere in their logic, believe they're making a copy when they're not.\n\nFor example:\ndef remove_whitespaces(text1):\n    chars = list(text1)\n    filtered_chars = chars  # Student thinks this is a copy\n    # Now remove whitespaces from filtered_chars\n    # But the student might do something that affects both\nBut wait, if we're removing elements, we'd use list comprehension or similar, which would actually create a new list. So that wouldn't exhibit the misconception properly.\n\nLet me think differently... What if the student tries to build a result by assignment thinking it creates a copy?\n\nActually, looking at the problem more carefully: the misconception is about lists specifically. The problem uses strings. Since strings are immutable in Python, this misconception about reference vs copy doesn't really manifest in the same problematic way.\n\nThis seems like a case where the misconception is not applicable to the given problem, because:\n1. The problem works with strings, not lists\n2. String operations in Python create new strings due to immutability\n3. The misconception specifically relates to mutable list behavior\n\n\n4. Attempting to artificially force a list-based solution would be contrived\n\nThe core insight is that the specific misconception about list references simply doesn't apply to immutable string operations.
