Looking at the given implementation:\n\n```py\ndef big_sum(nums):\n      sum= max(nums)+min(nums)\n      return sum\nIn this code, we have two function calls: `max(nums)` and `min(nums)`. \n\nIf the student believes functions are called without parentheses, they would write:\n```py\ndef big_sum(nums):\n      sum= max+min\n      return sum\nBut wait, this doesn't make sense in context. The student needs to somehow involve `nums`. Let me think about this more carefully.\n\nThe student believes that to call a function, you don't use parentheses. So when they want to call `max(nums)`, they might write `max nums` or just `max`. But in Python, `max nums` would be a syntax error. They might write `max` thinking it will somehow work with `nums`.\n\nActually, from the example, it seems like the student would just write `max` and `min` without any parentheses. So:\n\n```py\ndef big_sum(nums):\n      sum= max + min\n      return sum\nThis would not cause a syntax error - it would actually run. `max` and `min` are function objects, and in Python, you can't add function objects with `+`, which would cause a TypeError at runtime.\n\nActually wait, let me test this mentally: `max + min` would try to add two built-in function objects. This would raise a TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'builtin_function_or_method' and 'builtin_function_or_method'\n\nSo this would be a runtime error.\n\nThe student genuinely believes this code should work - they think that by referencing `max` and `min`, they're calling these functions (somehow implicitly on `nums`?). But that's not quite right either.\n\nLet me reconsider. \n\nI see the student fundamentally misunderstands function invocation. They believe simply referencing a function name somehow magically calls it, without understanding the need for parentheses and arguments. This misconception leads them to write syntactically incorrect code that would fail either at compile-time or runtime. The core issue is a lack of understanding about how functions are actually called in Python.\n\nThe student seems to imagine functions like `max` and `min` have some implicit behavior where they can operate on available data without explicit argument passing. They're trying to use these functions in ways that don't align with Python's syntax rules, revealing a deep misunderstanding of function mechanics.\n\nThis approach would trigger a runtime TypeError, exposing a fundamental gap in understanding how functions actually work in Python. The attempted code reflects a naive belief that programming languages can magically interpret programmer intent without precise instructions.",
