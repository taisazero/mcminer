What if the student wants to check divisors up to a certain point? They might think: \"I want to check from 2 to num minus num divided by 2\" and write `num - num / 2` expecting it to be `(num - num) / 2 = 0` when actually it's `num - (num/2) = num/2`.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently.

The student assumes subtraction would happen first, but division actually takes precedence, fundamentally changing the range of numbers being checked. The student might misunderstand integer division, creating subtle range calculation errors.
