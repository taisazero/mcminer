So they would write an if-statement where they think it needs to repeat, believing it will act like a while loop.\n\nFor example, in the calculation part:\n- For dogs 2 years or younger: multiply by 10.5\n- For dogs older than 2: 21 + (age - 2) * 4\n\nA student with this misconception might try to calculate the dog age by incrementing in a way that uses an if-statement thinking it will loop.\n\nLet me think of a scenario where the student would use if thinking it loops:\n\nOne possibility: The student might try to build up the age incrementally. For example, they might think:\n- Start with d_age = 0\n- If h_age > 0, add 10.5 to d_age and decrease h_age by 1\n- They expect this to repeat until h_age reaches 0 (or 2)\n\nLet me create a version where the student uses if-statements thinking they will loop:\n\n```py\ndef dog_age(h_age):\n    if h_age < 0:\n        exit()\n    \n    d_age = 0\n    \n    # For the first 2 years, add 10.5 per year\n    if h_age > 0 and h_age <= 2:\n        d_age = d_age + 10.5\n        h_age = h_age - 1\n    \n    # For years after 2, add 4 per year\n    if h_age > 2:\n        d_age = 21\n        h_age = h_age - 1\n        d_age = d_age + 4\n    \n    return d_age\n```\n\nI'll explore how a novice programmer might misunderstand control flow, believing if-statements can create repetitive behavior like loops.\n\nThe core misunderstanding stems from not recognizing the fundamental difference between conditional statements and iterative constructs. They mistakenly expect an if-statement to continue executing as long as its condition remains true, similar to how a while loop operates.\n\nThis misconception reveals a deeper struggle with understanding program control flow and the distinct purposes of different programming constructs. I see the core issue is the student misunderstands how the loop will actually execute. The code won't count all years as they expect, but will only increment once for the first two years and once for remaining years. This leads to a significant calculation error, dramatically undercalculating the dog's age. The specific problem is the conditional logic doesn't iterate through all years as the student assumes, resulting in an incorrect age computation that's much lower than the correct calculation.",
