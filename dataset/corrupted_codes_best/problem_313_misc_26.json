The given implementation uses `re.sub()` which returns a string, not a boolean.\n\nThe misconception is specifically about:\n1. Boolean return values\n2. Wrapping conditional expressions in if/else instead of returning them directly\n\nFor this misconception to apply, I would need to modify the problem solution to involve some boolean logic or conditional checking. However, the problem is asking to \"remove all whitespaces\" - it's not asking for a boolean check like \"does this string have whitespaces?\" or similar.\n\nSince the problem doesn't naturally involve returning boolean values or evaluating conditions that result in True/False, this misconception seems **inapplicable** to the given problem.\n\nThe misconception is about boolean returns and the student's belief that you need if/else to return boolean values from conditional expressions. But this problem is about string manipulation, not boolean returns.\n\nI should mark this as inapplicable because:\n- The problem doesn't involve returning boolean values\n- The problem doesn't involve conditional expressions that evaluate to True/False\n- There's no natural way to apply this specific misconception to a string manipulation problem\n\nThe misconception is specifically about boolean returns and wrapping `condition` in `if condition: return True else: return False` instead of just `return condition`. This doesn't relate to the string whitespace removal problem.",
