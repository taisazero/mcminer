Return a value immediately\n2. Then have unreachable code that checks some condition\n3. Believe that the return will only execute if that condition is met\n\nLet me think about how to apply this to the given problem. The student needs to find the largest number from the digits. \n\nOne way to show this misconception:\n- The student might loop through the array\n- Return a value early in the loop\n- Then have unreachable code that checks if they've processed all elements\n- Believing that the return will only happen when appropriate\n\nOr:\n- They build the number\n- Return it\n- Then have unreachable code that does some validation\n- Believing the return will only execute if validation passes\n\nLet me try:\n\n```py\ndef find_Max_Num(arr) : \n    n = len(arr)\n    arr.sort(reverse = True) \n    num = arr[0] \n    for i in range(1,n) : \n        num = num * 10 + arr[i]\n        return num  # Student thinks this will wait for the condition below\n        if i == n - 1:  # Unreachable\n            print(\"Done processing\")\n    return 0\nBut this doesn't make much sense for the problem. Let me think of a better way.\n\nActually, a more natural way for this specific problem:\n\n```py\ndef find_Max_Num(arr) : \n    n = len(arr)\n    arr.sort(reverse = True) \n    num = arr[0] \n    for i in range(1,n) : \n        return num  # Student thinks this will only execute after the loop finishes\n        num = num * 10 + arr[i]  # Unreachable\n    return num\nI'll demonstrate a scenario where the student misunderstands how `return` statements work, believing they can be conditionally influenced by unreachable code. The key is to create a code snippet that shows the student's incorrect mental model about control flow and return statements.\n\nThe implementation reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of how Python executes code. The student appears to think that a `return` statement can be somehow held back or modified by subsequent unreachable code, which is impossible. Once a `return` is encountered, the function immediately exits, making any code after it completely unreachable.\n\nThis misconception leads to a critical logical error where the function will always return just the first element of the sorted array, instead of constructing the maximum possible number as intended. The student needs to understand that `return` causes an immediate function exit, regardless of any code that follows.",
