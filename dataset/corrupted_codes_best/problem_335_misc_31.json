They treat `return` like a function call.\n\n**The Code to Analyze:**\n```python\ndef big_sum(nums):\n      sum= max(nums)+min(nums)\n      return(sum)\n```\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe code contains `return(sum)` with parentheses around the argument `sum`.\n\nIn Python, the `return` statement does NOT require parentheses. The correct, idiomatic way to write this would be:\n```python\nreturn sum\n```\n\nHowever, using `return(sum)` is syntactically valid Python because the parentheses are just grouping parentheses around the expression `sum`. Python allows this, but it's not the standard style and is unnecessary.\n\nThe question is: Does this code exhibit the misconception that `return` requires parentheses?\n\nThe answer is **YES**. The code shows `return(sum)` which is consistent with the belief that `return` needs parentheses around its argument, similar to a function call. While this code is syntactically and logically correct, the use of parentheses here suggests the student believes they are necessary or that `return` is a function that needs to be called with arguments.\n\nThe example in the misconception description shows:\n```python\nreturn(a + b)  # Unnecessary parentheses\n```\n\nAnd the code we're analyzing shows:\n```python\nreturn(sum)  # Also unnecessary parentheses\n```\n\nBoth follow the same pattern of putting parentheses around the return value, which is the hallmark of this misconception.\n\nEven though the code works correctly, the structure reveals a potential false belief - that `return` requires or should have parentheses like a function call. A student with correct understanding would typically write `return sum` without parentheses (unless there's a complex expression where parentheses are needed for clarity or operator precedence, but that's not the case here with a simple variable).\n \nThe evidence confirms the student's misunderstanding about `return` syntax. The unnecessary parentheses directly reflect the misconception that `return` operates like a function call requiring argument enclosure.",
