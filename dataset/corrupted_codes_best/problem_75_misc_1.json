It only uses while loops and pointer manipulation.\n\nSince the problem doesn't involve `range()` or any iteration that would naturally use `range()`, this misconception is not applicable to this problem. The solution uses a while loop with pointer manipulation, not a for loop with range.\n\nTo make this misconception relevant, I would need to somehow modify the solution to use `range()`, but that doesn't make sense for a linked list cycle detection problem where we don't know the length beforehand and we're using pointers.\n\nTherefore, I should output NONE with inapplicable: true.",
