However, the given implementation is a standalone function, not a class method. There's no `self` involved at all.\n\nFor this misconception to be applicable, the solution would need to:\n1. Be written as a class with methods\n2. Have a scenario where returning `self` would make sense\n\nLooking at the problem, it's asking for a function to find the next smallest palindrome. The given implementation is a standalone function. There's no natural reason to use a class or return `self` in this problem.\n\nThe misconception is about object-oriented programming and specifically about returning `self` from instance methods. This is commonly used in method chaining or builder patterns. However, this problem doesn't involve classes at all, and there's no obvious way to make it involve returning `self`.\n\nI think this misconception is **inapplicable** to this problem because:\n1.
