The student incorrectly believes that the code after the `return` statement could somehow influence the return value or execution, when in reality, the `return` immediately exits the function. This misconception reveals a critical gap in understanding how program execution works, particularly around function termination and unreachable code.\n\nThe key problem is the belief that subsequent code might retroactively validate or modify a return statement, which is completely impossible in actual program execution. The code after `return` will never be reached, making any conditions or logic there entirely irrelevant.",
