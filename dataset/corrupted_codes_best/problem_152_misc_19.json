The student should believe this code will still execute and is necessary for the solution.\n\nA natural way to do this would be to:\n1. Return early in the function\n2. Place some logic after the return that the student thinks will execute\n\nFor example, I could:\n- Return word_len early\n- Then try to do something else after, like additional processing\n\nLet me think of a realistic scenario where a student with this misconception would write code:\n\nOption 1: Return the result, then try to clean up or do additional processing\n```py\ndef long_words(n, str):\n    word_len = []\n    txt = str.split(\" \")\n    for x in txt:\n        if len(x) > n:\n            word_len.append(x)\n    return word_len\n    word_len = []  # Student thinks this cleans up the list\nOption 2: Return early in a conditional or loop, thinking code after will execute\n```py\ndef long_words(n, str):\n    word_len = []\n    txt = str.split(\" \")\n    for x in txt:\n        if len(x) > n:\n            word_len.append(x)\n            return word_len  # Student returns inside loop\n    # Student might think this is unreachable anyway\nWait, that second option doesn't really show the misconception well because returning in a loop is a different pattern.\n\nLet me think of a better way. \n\nI'll explore scenarios where students mistakenly believe they can perform additional operations after returning. They might attempt to clear variables or add final validations, not understanding that code after return is unreachable. The key is to create an example that clearly demonstrates their misunderstanding of how return statements terminate function execution.\n\nThe misconception stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of function flow. Students incorrectly assume return is a \"preparation\" step rather than an immediate exit point. This leads to writing code that looks logical but will never actually execute, potentially causing subtle logical errors that are hard to diagnose.\n\nThese attempts reveal a deeper need for understanding Python's function execution model, where return immediately stops further code processing. The student's intent might be good - wanting to clean up or finalize data - but their implementation fundamentally breaks core language behavior.",
