Because of the return statements, once one condition is met and returns, the function exits and the second if won't execute.

From their perspective, this is the correct way to handle it. They don't realize that `else` or `elif` would be more appropriate for mutually exclusive conditions.\n\nThis is actually a benign misconception in this case because the code still works correctly due to the return statements preventing the second condition from being evaluated after the first one succeeds.\n\nThis is similar to the example but the key difference is that in the example, they were assigning to a variable and then checking conditions, which caused overwriting. Here, we're returning, which exits the function, so there's no bug.\n\nThe student genuinely believes this is the right way - they think you should write separate if statements for mutually exclusive conditions.",
