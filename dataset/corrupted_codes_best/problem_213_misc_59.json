Use consonant-only variable names for numeric values\n2. If they must use vowel-containing names, they'd convert to strings or use different names\n\nLet me rewrite this following the student's belief:\n\nThe student would rename numeric variables to not contain vowels:\n- `h_age` → something like `hyrs`, `hg`, `yr`, `yrs`, etc.\n- `d_age` → something like `dg`, `dyrs`, `rsldt`, etc.\n\nOr they might keep the parameter name but immediately convert to a consonant-only variable.\n\nLet me create a version that shows this misconception clearly:\n\n```py\ndef dog_age(h_age):\n # Convert to consonant-only variable for numeric operations\n hyrs = int(h_age)\n if hyrs < 0:\n \texit()\n elif hyrs <= 2:\n\t dg = hyrs * 10.5\n else:\n\t dg = 21 + (hyrs - 2)*4\n return dg\nThe student's misunderstanding stems from a fundamental confusion about variable naming and type. They believe that the presence of vowels somehow restricts the variable's data type, creating an arbitrary and incorrect rule about variable naming. This misconception would lead them to unnecessarily complicate their code by renaming variables or converting types based on the presence of vowels.\n\nIn reality, variable names in Python can contain vowels and still store any type of data. The student would need to learn that variable naming is separate from variable type, and that the content and context determine what a variable can store. The student misunderstands type conversion, adding an unnecessary `int()` that can silently truncate float values. This creates a subtle logical error where precise decimal ages are incorrectly rounded down, potentially changing the calculated dog age significantly. For instance, a 2.5-year-old human would have their dog age calculated incorrectly due to this unnecessary type conversion.",
