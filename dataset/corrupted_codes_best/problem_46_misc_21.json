This means they would write `function_name` instead of `function_name()` when trying to call a function.\n\nLooking at the given implementation:\n```py\ndef find_smallest(list1): \n    min_val = list1[0] \n    for x in list1: \n        if x < min_val : \n             min_val = x  \n    return min_val\nThis function doesn't call any other functions within it that could demonstrate this misconception. The misconception would typically manifest when:\n1. Calling the function itself (e.g., `find_smallest [1,2,3]` instead of `find_smallest([1,2,3])`)\n2. Calling other functions within the implementation\n\nHowever, the problem asks to modify the code to exhibit the misconception. The student needs to believe their code solves the problem. \n\nOne way to exhibit this misconception would be to use a built-in function like `min()` but call it without parentheses. Let me think about how a student with this misconception might write this:\n\n```py\ndef find_smallest(list1):\n    return min list1  # Student thinks this calls min with list1\nBut this would cause a syntax error. The student genuinely believes this works, so they would write it this way.\n\nActually, looking at the example more carefully - the student omits parentheses when calling a function. So if they were to use `min()`, they'd write `min` without calling it properly.\n\nLet me create a modified version where the student tries to use a built-in function or method but forgets the parentheses:\n\n```py\ndef find_smallest(list1): \n    min_val = min list1\n    return min_val\nThis would cause a syntax error. The student believes this is correct.\n\nOr maybe they could try to call a method:\n\n```py\ndef find_smallest(list1):\n    return list1.sort[0]\nI'll modify the code to show the student's misconception about function calls. They would attempt to use the `min` function without proper syntax, believing it will work:\n\n```py\ndef find_smallest(list1):\n    result = min list1\n    return result\nThe student incorrectly thinks functions can be called without parentheses, leading to a syntax error that they don't understand.",
