There's no natural reason to have a conditional statement in this solution.\n\nLet me think... The misconception is specifically about conditional statements. If the given code doesn't use conditional statements, and there's no natural way to solve this problem with conditional statements (at least not in a way that a student would genuinely believe is the correct approach), then this misconception might be inapplicable.\n\nBut wait - maybe a student could think they need to check something? Like... no, that doesn't make sense for this problem. The problem is very straightforward: find max, find min, add them.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. A student with this misconception might try to add some validation or checking logic. For example, they might want to check if the array has elements, or check conditions during iteration if they're implementing max/min manually.\n\nLet me try a different approach - what if the student decides to implement their own max/min finding logic using loops and conditionals? Then they could use `=` instead of `==` in their comparisons.\n\nFor instance:\ndef big_sum(nums):\n    largest = nums[0]\n    smallest = nums[0]\n    for num in nums:\n        if num = largest:  # trying to check if num equals largest\n            largest = num\n        if num = smallest:\n            smallest = num\n    return largest + smallest\nWait, but this logic doesn't even make sense. Even from the student's perspective with the misconception, why would they check if num equals largest/smallest?\n \nI see a potential scenario where a student might mistakenly use assignment instead of comparison. In a manual implementation of finding max and min, they could accidentally use `=` when they intend to use `==` for comparison. The code would attempt to assign values instead of checking conditions, which would cause a syntax error or unexpected behavior. This highlights the critical difference between assignment (`=`) and comparison (`==`) in conditional statements.",
