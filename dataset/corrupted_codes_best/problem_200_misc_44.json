So I need to think about how a student with this misconception might approach this problem.\n\nLooking at the example, the student:\n- Avoids returning multiple values because they think you can only return one value\n- Doesn't understand tuple unpacking\n- Might try to use print statements or other workarounds\n- Would avoid `return a, b` syntax\n\nBut wait - the current problem doesn't naturally involve returning multiple values. It's just calculating a harmonic sum. So how would this misconception manifest?\n\nThe misconception is about misunderstanding tuple returns. Since the given solution doesn't involve tuples or multiple return values, this misconception might not be applicable to this specific problem.\n\nHowever, let me think if there's a way the student might unnecessarily complicate things or avoid certain patterns due to this misconception. But that seems forced.\n\nActually, looking at the problem more carefully, the misconception is specifically about `return a, b`. The given code doesn't use this pattern. The misconception wouldn't naturally manifest in solving this problem because there's no reason to return multiple values.\n\nI think the correct response here is to say the misconception is inapplicable because:\n1. The problem only requires returning a single value (the harmonic sum)\n2. The given solution doesn't involve tuple returns or multiple return values\n3. A student with this misconception would write code similar to the given implementation since it only returns one value\n\nThe misconception is about tuple returns, but this problem doesn't involve that concept at all.",
