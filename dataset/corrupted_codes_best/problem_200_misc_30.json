This would cause the function to not work correctly because:\n1. If they reassign n to a fixed value, the recursion won't work properly\n2. If they ask for input, it would ask for input on every recursive call\n\nLet me think about what a student might do:\n- They might reassign n from input\n- They might reassign n to some constant\n- They might reassign n to n itself (which would be benign but pointless)\n\nThe most likely scenario based on the example is that they would ask for input. However, this would be problematic in a recursive function as it would ask for input multiple times.\n\nAnother possibility is they might do something like `n = n` or `n = int(n)` thinking they need to \"initialize\" it.\n\nLet me go with the input() approach as it matches the example most closely. The student would overwrite the parameter with input, not understanding that the parameter already has a value passed to it.\n\nThis is a harmful misconception because it will cause the function to behave incorrectly - it will ask for input on every recursive call and ignore the passed parameter.\n\nThe error type would be `logical` because the code will run but produce incorrect results (and potentially ask for input multiple times).",
