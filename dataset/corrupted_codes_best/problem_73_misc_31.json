From their perspective, writing `return(matrix)` is not just acceptable but the *correct* way to do it.\n\nLet me modify the code:\n\n```py\ndef identity(n):\n    \n    matrix = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        row = [0] * n\n        matrix.append(row)\n\n    for tup in zip(list(range(n)), list(range(n))):\n        i, j = tup\n        matrix[i][j] = 1\n    return(matrix)\nThis is a minimal change that demonstrates the misconception. The code will work perfectly fine, but shows the student's belief that `return` requires parentheses.\n\nActually, I could be more consistent with the misconception and add parentheses to other function calls if the student is really thinking about it this way, but the misconception specifically mentions the return statement, so I'll keep it minimal and focused on that.\n\n\nI see a stylistic misunderstanding where the student views `return` as a function-like construct. The modification reflects a harmless belief that parentheses are required, with no actual impact on code functionality. This reveals a subtle nuance in the student's understanding of Python syntax.",
