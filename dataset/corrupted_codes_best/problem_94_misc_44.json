So the misconception about returning multiple values doesn't really apply here since there's no `return a, b` pattern.\n\nHowever, I need to think about how a student with this misconception might modify this code. The student believes that you cannot return multiple values properly in Python (or that `return a, b` doesn't work as expected). \n\nBut the problem is: the current solution only returns one value (a boolean). There's no multiple return values here. \n\nCould I modify the problem to make the student think they need to return multiple values? But that would be changing the problem itself. The problem asks to \"check whether the given two integers have opposite sign or not\" - which is a yes/no answer, so a single boolean return.\n\nSince the misconception is specifically about returning multiple values and the given solution doesn't return multiple values, this misconception is not applicable to this particular problem/solution.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. Could the student try to return multiple things even though the problem only asks for one? That seems like a stretch. The problem clearly asks for a check (boolean result), not multiple pieces of information.\n\nI think this is a case where the misconception is inapplicable because:\n1. The given solution returns only a single value (boolean)\n2. The problem asks for a single check/result\n3. The misconception is specifically about misunderstanding `return a, b` syntax, which isn't present or needed in this solution\n\nThis seems like a clear case for returning NONE with inapplicable: true.",
