For this misconception to be applicable, I need to consider if the student would modify the solution to use a class with an `__init__` method.\n\nA student with this misconception might:\n1. Create a class-based solution instead of a simple function\n2. Add an `__init__` method that explicitly returns `self`\n\nHowever, the problem specifically asks for \"Write a function\" - it doesn't require a class. Would a student with this misconception rewrite it as a class? That seems like a stretch.\n\nLet me think about this differently. The misconception is specifically about `__init__` methods. The given solution doesn't use classes or `__init__` at all. Therefore, this misconception is not really applicable to this problem unless we significantly rewrite the solution to use a class, which would be going beyond what the problem asks for.\n\nThe misconception relates to class initialization, but the problem and solution are about a simple function. There's no natural way to exhibit this misconception without completely changing the nature of the solution in a way that doesn't make sense for the problem.\n\nTherefore, I should output \"NONE\" with inapplicable: true, explaining that the misconception is about `__init__` methods in classes, but the problem doesn't involve classes.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. Could a student with this misconception decide to create a class-based solution? It's possible, but it would be a very unnatural fit for this simple problem. The problem clearly asks for \"a function\", not a class. A student who understands the problem would not typically create a class for this.\n\nI think the correct answer is that this misconception is inapplicable to this problem.",
