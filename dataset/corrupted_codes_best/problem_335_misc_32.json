          "raw_response": "<reasoning>\nLet me analyze this code and the misconception carefully.\n\n## The Misconception\nThe misconception is: \"Student believes that a `return` statement will conditionally execute based on conditions checked in subsequent unreachable code.\"\n\nIn the example, the student writes:\n```python\nreturn n  # Student expects this to \"wait\" until n is even\n# Unreachable code follows:\nif n % 2 == 0:\n    print(\"Found even number!\")\n```\n\nThe student believes that the `return` will somehow be affected by the condition check that comes AFTER it (which is unreachable).\n\n## The Code to Analyze\n```python\ndef big_sum(nums):\n    result = max(nums) + min(nums)\n    return result\n    if max(nums) != min(nums):\n        print(\"Valid sum calculated\")\n```\n\n## Analysis\n\nIn this code:\n1. The function calculates `result = max(nums) + min(nums)`\n2. It returns `result`\n3. After the return, there's unreachable code: `if max(nums) != min(nums): print(\"Valid sum calculated\")`\n\nDoes this exhibit the misconception? Let me think about what the student might believe:\n\nThe misconception is specifically about believing the return will **conditionally execute** based on conditions checked in subsequent unreachable code.\n\nIn this code:\n- There's a `return result` statement\n- There's a condition check AFTER the return: `if max(nums) != min(nums)`\n- There's a print statement inside that condition\n\nIf the student had this misconception, they might believe that:\n- The `return result` would only happen if `max(nums) != min(nums)` is true\n- Or that the validation/print would somehow affect whether the return happens\n\nThis does seem to match the pattern! The student has placed a conditional check after the return statement, which suggests they might believe the return is somehow affected by or related to this subsequent condition check.\n\nThe structure mirrors the example:\n\n\n- Example: `return n` followed by `if n % 2 == 0:`\n- This code: `return result` followed by `if max(nums) != min(nums):`\n\nThe code structure strongly indicates the student misunderstands how return statements work. They appear to believe the return is somehow contingent on the subsequent unreachable condition, when in reality, the code after `return` will never execute.\n\nThe validation check placed after the return suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of code execution flow. The student seems to think the return can be paused or modified by a later condition, which is impossible in Python's execution model.\n\nThis pattern reveals a deep misconception about how control flow and return statements actually function in programming. The student needs to understand that once a `return` statement is executed, the function immediately exits, and no subsequent code will run.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>\n<exhibits_misconception>Y</exhibits_misconception>\n<rationale>\nThis code exhibits the misconception. The student has placed a conditional check (`if max(nums) != min(nums)`) after the `return result` statement, which is unreachable code. The structure suggests the student believes the return might be affected by or wait for this subsequent condition check.\n\nSpecifically, the pattern matches the misconception:\n1. A return statement executes unconditionally (`return result`)\n2. Immediately followed by unreachable code containing a condition (`if max(nums) != min(nums)`)\n3. With logic that appears to \"validate\" the return (`print(\"Valid sum calculated\")`)\n\nThis structure suggests the student believes the validation check will somehow affect when or whether the return executes. A student with correct understanding would place any validation or conditional logic BEFORE the return statement, or would not include unreachable code at all. The placement of validation logic after the return is a clear indicator that the student expects the return to conditionally execute based on the subsequent unreachable condition.\n</rationale>\n<confidence>high</confidence>\n<feedback>NONE</feedback>\n</answer>",
