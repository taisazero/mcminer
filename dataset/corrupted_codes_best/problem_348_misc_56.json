Since the student believes identifiers can only be one letter, they would rename:\n- `count_Pairs` -> something like `c` (for count)\n- `arr` -> `a` (for array)\n- `cnt` -> could also be `c`, but that would conflict... maybe `t` (for total) or `r` (for result)\n\nLet me think about this more carefully.
