It's using it for recursion base case logic. \n\nThe question is: can I modify this code to exhibit the misconception? The misconception is specifically about wrapping conditional expressions in if/else statements when returning boolean values.\n\nLet me think... the harmonic_sum function doesn't return boolean values. It returns numbers. So the misconception about \"must wrap boolean expressions in if/else to return them\" doesn't really apply to this problem.\n\nHowever, I could potentially introduce a boolean check somewhere. But the problem asks to calculate the harmonic sum, not to return boolean values. So there's no natural place where this misconception would manifest.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The misconception is about believing that conditional statements that evaluate to True or False must be wrapped in if/else to be returned. This is about returning boolean values specifically.\n\nThe given code doesn't return boolean values - it returns numeric values (the harmonic sum). There's no place in the solution where we'd naturally return a boolean value. \n\nCould I force it? For example, could I add validation that returns a boolean? But that would change the problem significantly and wouldn't be a natural application of the misconception.\n\nI think this misconception is inapplicable to this problem because:\n\n\nThe harmonic sum calculation inherently requires numeric computations, not boolean checks. There's no meaningful way to introduce a boolean return without fundamentally altering the problem's core logic. The recursive function is designed to compute a mathematical series, which doesn't align with returning simple true/false values.",
