The student genuinely believes this will work.\n\nI could:\n1. Use `class` to store the result\n2. Use `class` as a parameter name\n3. Use `class` to store intermediate values\n\nLet me think about how a student with this misconception might approach this problem.

For example:\n\nimport re\ndef remove_whitespaces(text1):\n  class = re.sub(r'\\s+', '', text1)\n  return class\nOr maybe:\nimport re\ndef remove_whitespaces(class):\n  return (re.sub(r'\\s+', '', class))\nEither approach would demonstrate the misconception.
