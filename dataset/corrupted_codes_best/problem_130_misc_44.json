There's no natural reason to return multiple values.\n\nI could force it by maybe having the student want to return both the palindrome and something else (like how many iterations it took, or the original number, or whether it's a palindrome), but that would be changing the problem significantly and wouldn't make sense from the student's perspective of \"solving the problem correctly.\"\n\nThe misconception is about tuple returns, but this problem doesn't involve tuple returns at all. The misconception doesn't naturally apply to this problem.\n\nLet me reconsider - could the student refactor the solution in a way that would naturally involve multiple returns but then avoid it due to the misconception? \n\nFor example, maybe they could break down the problem into checking if something is a palindrome and finding the next one, and want to return multiple things, but then avoid it?\n\nBut that still seems forced.
