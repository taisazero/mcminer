So the misconception about multiple return values isn't directly applicable to this code.\n\nHowever, I need to think about how a student with this misconception might approach this problem. If they believe that `return a, b` creates multiple separate return values (not understanding it's actually a tuple), how would they write code for this whitespace removal problem?\n\nActually, looking at the example more carefully, the student with this misconception would AVOID using `return a, b` syntax because they think you can only return one value at a time. They might not understand that it's actually returning a tuple.\n\nBut this problem only needs to return one value anyway - the cleaned string. So the misconception doesn't really apply here.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. Could the student try to return multiple things even though it's not needed? That seems forced and wouldn't be genuine student work.\n\nThe misconception is about multiple return values, but this problem only requires returning a single string. The given solution already only returns a single value. There's no natural way to apply this misconception to this problem because:\n1. The problem doesn't call for multiple return values\n2. The original solution doesn't use multiple return values\n3. A student with this misconception would just write code that returns one value (which is already what's happening)\n\nThis seems like a case where the misconception is inapplicable to the given problem.",
