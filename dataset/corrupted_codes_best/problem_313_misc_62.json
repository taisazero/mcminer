Convert the string to a list\n2. Try to remove whitespace characters using `.pop()` with the value (space character) instead of the index\n3. Convert back to string\n\nThe student would believe that `list.pop(' ')` would remove all spaces from the list, when in reality pop() expects an index.\n\nLet me write code that demonstrates this:\n\ndef remove_whitespaces(text1):\n    char_list = list(text1)\n    while ' ' in char_list:\n        char_list.pop(' ')\n    return ''.join(char_list)\nThe student believes that `char_list.pop(' ')` will remove the space character from the list. In reality, this will cause a TypeError because pop() expects an integer index, not a string value.\n\nThis is a harmful misconception because it will cause a runtime error (TypeError: 'str' object cannot be interpreted as an integer).\n\nWait, let me think about this more carefully. The misconception states that the student believes pop() takes a value to be deleted. So they would genuinely write code like this thinking it works.\n\nActually, looking at the example, when they do `nums.pop(10)`, they get an IndexError because Python interprets 10 as an index (not a value), and the list doesn't have that many elements. So the student's misconception leads them to write code that causes an error.\n\nIn my modified code, if the student writes `char_list.pop(' ')`, Python would try to interpret ' ' as an index, which would cause a TypeError since it's a string, not an integer.\n \nThe student attempts to remove whitespaces by incorrectly using `.pop()` with character values.
