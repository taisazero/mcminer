Let me think about this...\n\nActually, with square brackets, you can't do keyword arguments like `reverse = True` directly. The student might write it as `arr.sort[reverse = True]` which would be a syntax error.\n\nBut looking at the example, the student just replaces the parentheses with square brackets: `double[5]`. So they would write:\n\n\n- Attempting to use square brackets for function calls would create syntax errors\n- Keyword arguments cannot be passed using square brackets\n- The method calls would fail because square brackets are for indexing, not calling functions\n\nI see the student's fundamental misunderstanding is confusing function call syntax with list indexing.
