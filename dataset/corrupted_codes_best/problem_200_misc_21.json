If the student believes functions are called without parentheses, they would write `harmonic_sum` instead of `harmonic_sum(n - 1)`.\n\nHowever, they still need to pass the argument `n - 1`. This creates a problem - how would they express this? \n\nLooking at the example, the student omits parentheses entirely when there are no arguments. But in a recursive call with an argument, what would they do?\n\nOne interpretation: The student might think you can just reference the function name without parentheses when you want to call it, but they'd still be confused about how to pass arguments. They might think the function somehow \"knows\" what argument to use, or they might place the argument in an unusual way.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. If the student believes functions are called without parentheses, they might write:\nreturn 1 / n + harmonic_sum\nBut this wouldn't make sense even to them because they need to pass `n - 1`. \n\nPerhaps the student thinks that you reference the function without parentheses but somehow the argument is implicit or handled differently. But this seems inconsistent.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. The misconception states \"functions are called without parentheses.\" In the example, `get_value` is used instead of `get_value()`. \n\nFor a function with parameters, the student might think they can call it without parentheses somehow. But syntactically, how would they pass arguments?\n\nMaybe the student would try something like:\nreturn 1 / n + harmonic_sum n - 1\n\n\nBut this would be a syntax error. The student likely misunderstands how function calls work, attempting to invoke the function without proper syntax. They might not realize that parentheses are crucial for passing arguments and actually calling a function.\n\nThe most probable outcome is a runtime error where they attempt to add a function object to a number, revealing a fundamental misunderstanding of function invocation in Python.",
