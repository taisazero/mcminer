In Python, division actually has higher precedence than addition.\n\nLooking at the given code:\n```py\ndef get_Inv_Count(arr): \n    inv_count = 0\n    for i in range(len(arr)): \n        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)): \n            if (arr[i] > arr[j]): \n                inv_count += 1\n    return inv_count\nThis code doesn't involve division `/` at all, so there's no place where the precedence between `+` and `/` would matter. The only arithmetic operations are:\n- `i + 1` (addition)\n- `inv_count += 1` (which is `inv_count = inv_count + 1`)\n\nThere's no division operation in this code, so the misconception about the precedence of `+` and `/` cannot be demonstrated here. The misconception is not applicable to this problem/solution.\n\nWait, let me think if there's a way to modify the solution to incorporate this misconception. The problem is to count inversions in an array. Could a student with this misconception write a different solution that involves division?\n\nHmm, maybe they could try to calculate some kind of ratio or percentage? But that would be changing the problem significantly and wouldn't be a natural solution to the inversion counting problem.\n\nOr maybe they could try to normalize something? But again, that doesn't make sense for counting inversions.\n\nThe misconception is specifically about the precedence of `+` and `/`. Since the correct solution doesn't use division at all, and there's no natural reason to use division in counting inversions, this misconception is not applicable to this particular problem/solution.",
