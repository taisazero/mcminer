The expression `2 + num * 3` seems unusual for a prime checker (it would create a very large range). The expression `(2 + num) * 3` would also be unusual but slightly more bounded.\n\nHowever, **I cannot definitively determine the student's intent** from the code alone. The code is written as `2 + num * 3`, which:\n- Could be intentional (student knows precedence correctly)\n- Could reflect the misconception (student wanted `(2 + num) * 3` but wrote it without parentheses thinking `+` goes first)\n\n**Key consideration:** The code structure itself doesn't show clear evidence of the misconception. The student simply wrote an arithmetic expression. Without knowing their intended logic or seeing them explicitly avoid parentheses when they should use them, I cannot conclude they hold this misconception.\n\nThe code has other serious bugs (returning on first iteration, wrong prime logic), but these don't relate to operator precedence misconceptions.\n\n<answer>\n<exhibits_misconception>N</exhibits_misconception>\n<confidence>medium</confidence>\n</answer>",
