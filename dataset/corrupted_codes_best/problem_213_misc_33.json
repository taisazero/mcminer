So they would convert all `elif` and `else` to `if`.\n\nActually, looking at the example more carefully:\n- The student converts `elif` to `if`\n- They might also convert `else` to `if` with the opposite condition\n\nLet me think about this... In the example, the student uses multiple `if` statements for what should be `elif` chains. This causes the later conditions to potentially overwrite earlier assignments.\n\nFor the dog age problem:\n- `if h_age < 0: exit()`\n- `elif h_age <= 2: d_age = h_age * 10.5`\n- `else: d_age = 21 + (h_age - 2)*4`\n\nIf the student converts this to all `if` statements:\n```py\ndef dog_age(h_age):\n if h_age < 0:\n \texit()\n if h_age <= 2:\n\t d_age = h_age * 10.5\n if h_age > 2:\n\t d_age = 21 + (h_age - 2)*4\n return d_age\nI realize the conditions are mutually exclusive, so this implementation would actually work correctly. The potential issue depends on the specific conditions and their overlap.\n\nThe key problem emerges when conditions aren't perfectly non-overlapping, potentially causing unexpected behavior in calculation or assignment.\n\nFor the dog age calculation, the separate `if` statements might function as intended, but they reveal a fundamental misunderstanding about control flow and conditional logic. The student's approach, while technically functional, lacks the precision and clarity of using `elif` to handle mutually exclusive conditions.\n\nThe critical insight is how conditional statements interact, especially when dealing with input validation and age-based calculations. Precise condition ordering and selection matters significantly in preventing unintended computational paths.\n\nThe exit scenario highlights potential pitfalls in error handling and program flow, demonstrating why structured conditional branching is crucial for robust code design.\n\nI see the conditions are technically mutually exclusive, which means the separate `if` statements won't cause immediate issues here. However, the approach remains problematic because it lacks clear logical hierarchy and could introduce subtle bugs in more complex scenarios.\n\nThe key insight is that while this specific implementation might work, it violates fundamental programming principles of clear, intentional control flow. Separate `if` statements invite potential errors by not explicitly defining a clear decision tree, especially when handling edge cases like negative ages or boundary conditions.\n\nThe student's code reveals a deeper misunderstanding about conditional logic structure, suggesting a need for more precise programming techniques that prioritize readability and predictability.
