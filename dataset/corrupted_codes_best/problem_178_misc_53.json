It doesn't use `self` at all. There's no instance of a class involved, no `self` parameter.\n\nThe misconception is specifically about using `self` as a return value in class methods. Since the given problem and solution don't involve classes or `self`, this misconception cannot be applied here.\n\nThe misconception is inapplicable because:\n1.
