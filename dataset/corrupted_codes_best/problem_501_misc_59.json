In this case, `flip_coin()` does return a string ('Heads' or 'Tails'), so this is already appropriate according to the student's misconception.\n\nTo show the misconception more clearly, I should:\n1. Maybe use consonant-only variable names where the student thinks they're storing non-strings (even though they're strings)\n2. Or rename variables to follow this pattern more explicitly\n3. Show the student actively avoiding vowels in variable names when they think they're dealing with non-strings\n\nActually, thinking about this more carefully: the student believes vowel-containing names can ONLY store strings, and consonant-only names can store ANY type. So:\n- If storing a string, the student might use either (but prefers vowel-containing names)\n- If storing a non-string (int, bool, etc.), the student MUST use consonant-only names\n\nIn this problem, everything is strings, so the student might not demonstrate the misconception strongly unless they misunderstand what type something is, or they deliberately choose vowel-containing names for strings.\n\nWait, let me re-read the example. The student stores age as a string \"25\" because the variable name `age` has vowels. They think because the variable name has vowels, they MUST store it as a string.\n\n\nThe student's misunderstanding stems from a bizarre linguistic connection between variable names and data types.

So:\n- Vowel names → strings only\n- Consonant names → any type (including strings)\n\nUnder this interpretation:\n- `chs` (no vowels) stores a list - OK (consonant names can store any type)\n- `flp` (no vowels) stores a string - OK (consonant names can store any type, including strings)\n- `outcome`, `coin_result`, `message` (all have vowels) all store strings - consistent with the rule\n\nBut this is a very weak signal. The code deals exclusively with strings (coin flip results), so it's natural that most variables store strings. There's no evidence of:\n- Avoiding vowel names for non-string data\n- Converting types unnecessarily\n- Using awkward consonant-only names for numeric data\n\nThe variable names seem reasonable and idiomatic. `chs` for \"choices\" and `flp` for \"flip\" are just abbreviations, not attempts to avoid vowels for type reasons. The code doesn't show any numeric values being stored in consonant-only variables as a pattern.\n\n<answer>\n<exhibits_misconception>N</exhibits_misconception>\n<confidence>high</confidence>\n</answer>",
