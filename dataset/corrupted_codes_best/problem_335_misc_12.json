So the student might just write:\n\ndef big_sum(nums):\n    sum = max(nums) + min(nums)\n    # No return statement because they think sum is accessible outside\nOr they might think they can return but also access it:\n\ndef big_sum(nums):\n    result = max(nums) + min(nums)\n    return result\n\n# Student might expect to access 'result' here too\nI'll focus on the core misunderstanding about function scope. The student incorrectly assumes local variables can be accessed globally, leading to code that fails to properly return or use function results.
