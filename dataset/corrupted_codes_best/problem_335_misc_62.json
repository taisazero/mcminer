Let me think...\n\nActually, if the student believes pop() takes a value, they might still use max() and min() to find the values, then try to pop them. Or they might try a different approach altogether.\n\nLet me create a scenario where the student:\n1. Finds max and min using max() and min()\n2. Tries to \"clean up\" by popping these values from the list (thinking they're being thorough)\n3.

Trying to remove values by their actual value instead of their index leads to critical errors. In the example with `nums = [1, 2, 10]`, the student would attempt to pop at index 10, which doesn't exist, causing an IndexError. This misconception highlights the importance of understanding how list methods actually work.\n\nThe proposed solution shows a naive approach to solving the problem, mistakenly believing that removing specific values is necessary or helpful. In reality, simply finding the max and min values and summing them is the correct strategy.\n\nThe code attempts to pop values by their actual values, which fundamentally misunderstands how list indexing works. This misconception would trigger runtime errors when trying to remove elements that don't exist at the specified indices.\n\nI see a fundamental misunderstanding of list manipulation and method usage that could lead to unexpected program behavior.",
