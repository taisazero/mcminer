To demonstrate the misconception, I would need to introduce a scenario where both `+` and `/` appear in the same expression.\n\nHowever, the problem is simply counting occurrences of 'std' in a string. There's no natural reason to use division in this context. The misconception is about operator precedence between `+` and `/`, but the given problem doesn't require division at all.\n\nSince the misconception relates to division and addition operations together, and the current problem/solution doesn't use division (and doesn't naturally require it), this misconception is not applicable to this problem.\n\nThe misconception is specifically about arithmetic operations with `+` and `/` in the same expression, but the given solution only uses `+` for incrementing a counter and doesn't involve any division operations.
