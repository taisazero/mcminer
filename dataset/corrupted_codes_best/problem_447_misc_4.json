The misconception is about how to use boolean expressions in if statements, but this solution doesn't have any if statements.\n\nSince the misconception is about explicit comparison to True/False in conditionals, and the given code doesn't have any conditionals, this misconception is not applicable to this particular problem/solution.\n\nLet me verify: The misconception is specifically about conditional statements that evaluate to True or False needing explicit comparison.
