The correct implementation doesn't use any conditional statements or comparisons, so the misconception about using `=` for equality comparison isn't directly applicable to this problem.\n\nHowever, I need to think about how a student with this misconception might solve this problem. The student believes `=` is used for equality comparison. They might try to incorporate some conditional logic where they compare values, but that wouldn't really fit with the problem's requirements.\n\nLet me think... could the student add unnecessary conditional logic? For example, they might try to check if something is true before performing the multiplication? But that seems like a stretch and wouldn't really be something a student would genuinely believe is the correct solution.\n\nActually, wait. The problem is straightforward - multiply two numbers. There's no natural place where a conditional statement would be needed. The misconception is about using `=` in conditional statements, but this problem doesn't require conditional statements at all.\n\nSince the misconception is specifically about equality comparison in conditional statements, and this problem doesn't involve any conditional logic, I think this misconception is inapplicable to the given problem.\n\nThe misconception would only be relevant if the solution naturally required a conditional statement with an equality check. Since the problem is just about returning `a * b`, there's no logical reason for a student (even one with this misconception) to add conditional logic.",
