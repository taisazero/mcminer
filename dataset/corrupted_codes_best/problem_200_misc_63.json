In reality, division has higher precedence than addition in Python (and most programming languages).\n\n## Analyzing the Code\n\nThe key line to examine is:\n```python\nreturn 1 / n + harmonic_sum(n - 1)\n```\n\nLet me consider what this expression does:\n- **Actual evaluation (correct precedence)**: `(1 / n) + harmonic_sum(n - 1)`\n  - Division happens first: `1 / n`\n  - Then addition: result + harmonic_sum(n - 1)\n\n- **If student believed + has higher precedence**: They might expect `1 / (n + harmonic_sum(n - 1))`\n  - Addition would happen first: `n + harmonic_sum(n - 1)`\n  - Then division: `1 / result`\n\n## Key Question: Does the code structure reveal the misconception?\n\nFor this code to exhibit the misconception, the student would need to have written `1 / n + harmonic_sum(n - 1)` while **intending** something different due to their false belief about precedence.\n\nHowever, looking at the function's purpose (calculating harmonic sum), the expression `1 / n + harmonic_sum(n - 1)` is **mathematically correct** for computing the harmonic series: H(n) = 1/n + 1/(n-1) + ... + 1/1.\n\nThe student wrote code that:\n1. Correctly implements the harmonic sum formula\n2. Relies on the actual (correct) precedence where `/` comes before `+`\n3. Would be **incorrect** if the student's believed precedence (+ before /) were true\n\nIf the student truly believed `+` has higher precedence than `/`, they would have written the code differently (likely with explicit parentheses like `(1 / n) + harmonic_sum(n - 1)`) to ensure division happens first, OR they would have written incorrect code that doesn't compute the harmonic sum properly.\n\nThe fact that this code is correct and works as intended suggests the student **correctly understands** that division has higher precedence than addition.\n\n<answer>\n<exhibits_misconception>N</exhibits_misconception>\n<confidence>high</confidence>\n</answer>",
