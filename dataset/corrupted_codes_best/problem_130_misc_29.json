Use `class` as a variable name somewhere in the solution\n2. This would cause a SyntaxError\n\nSince the misconception is about using `class` as a variable identifier, I need to modify the code to use `class` as a variable name. For example, I could:\n- Store the result in a variable called `class`\n- Use `class` to store some intermediate value\n\nLet me think about what makes sense in the context of this problem. Perhaps the student might think of \"class\" as meaning \"category\" or \"type\" of number (palindrome vs non-palindrome), or they might just use it as a general variable name without realizing it's reserved.\n\nA reasonable modification would be to use `class` to store the candidate number being checked, or to store the result. Let me try:\n\n```py\nimport sys\ndef next_smallest_palindrome(num):\n    numstr = str(num)\n    for i in range(num+1,sys.maxsize):\n        if str(i) == str(i)[::-1]:\n            class = i\n            return class\nThis would cause a SyntaxError because `class` is a reserved keyword. The student believes they can use `class` as a variable name, so from their perspective, this code should work fine - they're just storing the result in a variable before returning it.\n\nThis is a harmful misconception because it causes a syntax error.",
