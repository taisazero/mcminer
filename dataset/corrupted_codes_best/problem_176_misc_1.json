The docstring explicitly states the function should sum elements \"from index m to index n **inclusive**\", but the implementation uses `range(m, n)`, which in Python only iterates from m to n-1 (excluding n).\n\nIf the student correctly understood that `range(m, n)` excludes n, they would have written `range(m, n+1)` to achieve the inclusive behavior described in the docstring. The fact that they wrote `range(m, n)` when intending to include n strongly suggests they believe `range(m, n)` produces values from m to n inclusive - which is exactly the misconception.\n\nThis is a clear pattern: the student's intent (documented in the docstring) doesn't match the actual behavior of their code, and the discrepancy aligns precisely with the described misconception about how range() works.\n</rationale>\n<confidence>high</confidence>\n<feedback>NONE</feedback>\n</answer>",
