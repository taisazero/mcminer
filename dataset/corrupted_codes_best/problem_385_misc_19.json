This is a harmful misconception because it leads to logical errors - the student writes code expecting certain operations to happen, but they never do.\n\nLooking at the given implementation, it has some issues already (the indentation and logic aren't quite right for a proper prime checker), but I need to modify it to show this misconception.\n\nThe student who believes code after return executes might:\n1. Put a return statement early but add more logic after it, expecting it to run\n2. Structure the function in a way that shows they expect execution to continue after return\n\nLet me think about how to apply this to the prime number checker:\n\nA student with this misconception might:\n- Return True/False early but then try to add additional checks after the return\n- Or restructure the logic so that they return something but expect more code to execute\n\nFor example, they might write something like:\ndef prime_num(num):\n    if num >= 1:\n        for i in range(2, num//2):\n            if (num % i) == 0:\n                return False\n                # They might add code here thinking it executes\n        return True\n        # Or add code here\n    else:\n        return False\n        # Or add code here\nBut a more obvious demonstration would be if they put important logic after a return statement. For instance:\n\ndef prime_num(num):\n    if num < 2:\n        return False\n    \n    return True  # They return True early\n    \n    # But they think this code still runs to check divisibility\n    for i in range(2, num//2):\n        if (num % i) == 0:\n            return False\nThis would show the misconception clearly - the student believes that returning True doesn't stop the function, and the loop will still check for divisibility.\n\nOr another approach:\ndef prime_num(num):\n    if num < 2:\n        return False\n    \n    for i in range(2, num//2):\n        if (num % i) == 0:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n    \n    # Student adds extra check thinking it will run\n    if num == 1:\n        return False\nI see a critical misunderstanding about function execution. The student incorrectly assumes that a return statement is more of a suggestion than a definitive exit point for a function. This leads to writing unreachable code that they mistakenly believe will somehow execute.\n\nThe key problem is a fundamental miscomprehension of how return works - it immediately terminates the function's execution, preventing any subsequent code from running. This misconception can lead to subtle and hard-to-detect bugs where critical logic is completely ignored.\n\nThe most clear demonstration would involve placing main logic after an early return, showing how the student fundamentally misunderstands function termination. The code will silently fail, with the programmer unaware that their carefully written logic never actually runs.",
