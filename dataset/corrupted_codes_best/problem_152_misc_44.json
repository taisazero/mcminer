They think it's returning multiple separate values somehow, and they might avoid this pattern or try to work around it in incorrect ways.\n\nLooking at the given implementation:\n```py\ndef long_words(n, str):\n    word_len = []\n    txt = str.split(\" \")\n    for x in txt:\n        if len(x) > n:\n            word_len.append(x)\n    return word_len\nThis function only returns one thing - a list. There's no multiple return values here. So the misconception doesn't directly apply to this code as written.\n\nHowever, the student might try to refactor or approach this problem differently because of their misconception. For instance, they might want to return both the list of long words AND the count, but because of their misconception, they would avoid the pattern `return word_len, count` and instead:\n1. Only return one value\n2. Use print statements for the other information\n3. Make separate function calls\n4. Or restructure the solution in some way\n\nBut wait - the problem statement is: \"Write a function to find words that are longer than n characters from a given list of words.\" It only asks for the words themselves, not multiple things.\n\nSince the original solution doesn't involve returning multiple values, and the problem doesn't naturally call for returning multiple values, this misconception is not really applicable to this specific problem/solution.\n\nLet me reconsider... Could the student have misunderstood the problem or tried to add extra functionality? Maybe they think they need to return both the words and their lengths? Or the words and the count?\n\nBut that would be changing the problem requirements, not demonstrating the misconception in the context of solving this specific problem.\n\nI think this is a case where the misconception is inapplicable because:\n\n\nThe problem's simplicity renders the multiple-return-value misunderstanding irrelevant. The function cleanly returns a single list of long words, leaving no room for confusion about return mechanisms.",
