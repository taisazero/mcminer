However, the given solution doesn't use lists at all - it only uses numeric values and simple arithmetic.\n\nTo apply this misconception, I would need to modify the solution to involve lists in some way. But the question is: would a student who has this misconception naturally rewrite this problem to use lists? \n\nThe problem is fundamentally about calculating a single numeric value based on another numeric value. There's no natural reason to introduce lists into this solution. The misconception is about list assignment behavior, which is simply not relevant to this problem.\n\nThis seems like a case where the misconception is **inapplicable** because:\n1. The original solution doesn't use lists\n2. There's no reasonable way a student with this specific misconception would introduce lists into this problem\n3. The misconception is about a specific language construct (list assignment) that has no bearing on the problem at hand\n\nI should return NONE with an explanation that the misconception is inapplicable.",
