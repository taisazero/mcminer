Let me think about how a student with this specific misconception would approach this problem.\n\nActually, the student's misconception is specifically about the in-place modification aspect, not necessarily about what `strip()` does. But to demonstrate the misconception about in-place modification, I need to use `strip()` or similar string methods.\n\nA student who believes string methods modify in place might write:\ndef remove_whitespaces(text1):\n    text1.strip()  # They think this modifies text1 in place\n    return text1\nBut wait, `strip()` only removes leading/trailing whitespace, not all whitespace.

The student calls `replace()` but doesn't assign the result back, thinking it modifies `text1` directly.\n\n\nThe misconception would lead to a critical error where the function fails to actually remove whitespaces.
