The misconception is about **class initialization**. These are fundamentally different concepts.\n\nEven if I rewrote this as a class-based solution (which would be overengineering for this simple problem), it would be such a drastic departure from the given implementation that it wouldn't make sense. The student would need to misunderstand the problem itself, not just have a misconception about `__init__`.\n\nThis misconception is **inapplicable** to this problem because:\n1.
