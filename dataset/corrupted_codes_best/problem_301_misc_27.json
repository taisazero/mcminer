The given implementation uses conditional statements to check if tuples form bidirectional pairs.\n\nThe misconception is that the student believes conditional statements must be wrapped in a ternary operator to be returned as Boolean values.\n\nLooking at the given code:\ndef count_bidirectional(test_list):\n  res = 0\n  for idx in range(0, len(test_list)):\n    for iidx in range(idx + 1, len(test_list)):\n      if test_list[iidx][0] == test_list[idx][1] and test_list[idx][1] == test_list[iidx][0]:\n        res += 1\n  return res\nThe code has an `if` statement with a conditional expression. The misconception is about returning boolean values wrapped in ternary operators. However, this code doesn't return a boolean - it returns an integer count.\n\nTo exhibit this misconception in this context, I need to think about where boolean values might be involved. The student might:\n1. Not understand that the condition in the `if` statement is already a boolean\n2. Wrap the condition unnecessarily in a ternary operator\n\nBut the misconception specifically talks about \"returning\" boolean values. Since this function doesn't return a boolean, I need to think about how a student with this misconception might approach this problem.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The misconception is about believing that conditional expressions that evaluate to True or False must be wrapped in a ternary operator to be returned. This is specifically about the `return` statement.\n\nSince the given function doesn't return a boolean, maybe the student with this misconception wouldn't write this code any differently? In that case, the misconception would be inapplicable.\n\nHowever, I could imagine a student who has this misconception might also apply it to other contexts where they're evaluating boolean expressions, not just return statements. But that would be stretching the misconception beyond what's described.\n \nThe key insight is that the function returns an integer count, not a boolean value. The misconception about wrapping boolean returns in ternary operators simply doesn't apply here. The conditional check inside the function is a standard boolean evaluation that doesn't require any special wrapping or conversion.",
