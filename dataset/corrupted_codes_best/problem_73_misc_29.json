But that seems a bit contrived.\n\nMore naturally, a student might use `class` as a loop variable or for storing some intermediate value. Let me replace `tup` with `class` or maybe `row` with `class`.\n\nActually, replacing `row` with `class` might make some sense if the student is thinking about each row as a \"class\" of elements or something. Or maybe they're just using it as a generic variable name without realizing it's reserved.\n\nLet me go with replacing `matrix` with `class` - the student might think \"class\" is a good name for a collection/class of rows. \n\nI'll choose `tup` as the variable to replace with `class`, as it's a generic variable name a student might casually use.
