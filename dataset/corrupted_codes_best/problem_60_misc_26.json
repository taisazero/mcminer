However, the given problem is about returning the product of two integers, not about returning a Boolean value.\n\nLet me think about how this misconception could be applied to this problem. The problem asks to return `a * b`, which is an arithmetic operation, not a Boolean expression.\n\nFor this misconception to be applicable, the problem would need to involve returning a Boolean value based on some condition. Since this problem is purely about multiplication and returning an integer result, there's no natural way to apply this misconception.\n\nThe misconception is specifically about:\n- Believing conditional expressions need if/else wrapping to return Boolean values\n- Not realizing you can directly return the result of a Boolean expression\n\nBut in this problem:\n- We're not dealing with Boolean values\n- We're not dealing with conditional logic\n- We're just doing arithmetic\n\nTherefore, this misconception is not applicable to this problem.",
