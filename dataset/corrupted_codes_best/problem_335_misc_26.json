The problem is purely about numeric operations (finding max, min, and their sum).\n\nThe misconception would be relevant if:\n- The problem asked to check if something is true or false\n- The solution involved comparing values and returning boolean results\n- There were any conditional logic that evaluated to True/False\n\nBut this problem is about summing numbers, not about boolean logic.\n\nTherefore, I should output NONE with inapplicable: true.",
