Perhaps they want to store the result in a variable before returning it, and they choose `class` as the variable name (maybe they're thinking of \"classification\" or just chose it randomly without knowing it's reserved).\n\nHere's a possible modification:\n\ndef Product(a, b):\n    class = a * b\n    return class\nThis would result in a SyntaxError because `class` is a reserved keyword.
