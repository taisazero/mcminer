The current solution builds up a list of words that satisfy the condition. \n\nHow can I modify this to show the misconception about `.pop()`? \n\nOne approach: Instead of building up a list of words that ARE longer than n, the student could:\n1. Start with all words\n2. Try to remove words that are NOT longer than n using `.pop()`\n\nThe student would believe that `.pop(x)` removes the value `x` from the list, so they might write something like:\n\ndef long_words(n, str):\n    txt = str.split(\" \")\n    word_len = txt.copy()  # or list(txt)\n    for x in txt:\n        if len(x) <= n:\n            word_len.pop(x)  # Student thinks this removes the word x\n    return word_len\nThis would cause a runtime error because `.pop(x)` where x is a string would try to interpret x as an index. If x is something like \"hello\", it would fail with a TypeError.\n\nActually, let me think more carefully. If x is a string like \"hello\", calling `word_len.pop(\"hello\")` would raise a TypeError because pop() expects an integer index, not a string value.\n\nSo this would be a harmful misconception with a runtime error.\n\nLet me verify: `list.pop([i])` - removes and returns the item at position i. If no index is specified, it removes the last item. The student thinks it takes a value to remove.\n\nSo if the student writes `word_len.pop(x)` where x is a string, it will cause a TypeError at runtime.\n \nThis reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of list manipulation methods. The student incorrectly assumes `.pop()` can remove elements by their value, not realizing it requires a specific index.
