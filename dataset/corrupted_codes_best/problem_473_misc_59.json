The student genuinely believes this is the correct way to write code\n\nLet me rewrite the code following this misconception:\n- `Sum` (has 'u') stores a number, so needs to be renamed to something without vowels\n- `i` (has 'i') is a loop counter (number), so needs consonant-only name\n- `arr` (has 'a') stores a list, not a string, so needs consonant-only name\n- `l` is already consonant-only, so it's fine for storing a number\n\nNew names:\n- `Sum` → `sm` or `ttl` (total) or `rslt` (result)\n\n\n- `i` → `ndx` or `cnt` or just any consonant-only name\n- `arr` → `lst` or `vls` (values) or `nmbrs` (numbers)\n- `l` stays as is (already consonant-only)\n\nThe renaming process follows a bizarre rule of avoiding vowels for non-string variables.

This could simply be:\n- A preference for short variable names\n- Common abbreviations (sm for sum, l for length, ndx for index, lst for list)\n- Coincidence\n\nThere's no evidence of the student using vowel-containing names for strings or showing awareness of a vowel-based naming rule. The misconception requires a pattern where the student demonstrates they believe vowels dictate string storage - we would need to see them using vowel names for strings AND avoiding vowels for other types in a way that suggests intentional rule-following.\n\nThis code just shows abbreviated variable names, which is a common (though not always recommended) coding style.",
