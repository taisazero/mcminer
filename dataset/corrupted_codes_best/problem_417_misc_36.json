The student believes it works like `.sort()` method which does modify in-place.\n\nHowever, looking at the given implementation, there's no use of `sorted()` or any sorting operation. The problem is about adding a dictionary to a tuple, not sorting anything.\n\nFor this misconception to be applicable, I would need to:\n1. Either introduce sorting into the solution (which doesn't make sense for this problem)\n2. Or conclude that this misconception is inapplicable to this problem\n\nSince the problem has nothing to do with sorting, and the misconception is specifically about `sorted()` modifying lists in place, this misconception is **inapplicable** to this problem.\n\nThe misconception is about sorted() function, but the problem is about adding a dictionary to a tuple.
