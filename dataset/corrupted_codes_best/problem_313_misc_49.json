This means they think that in an expression like `func1(func2(x))`, `func1` would be called before `func2`, which is incorrect.\n\nIn the given code:\n```py\nimport re\ndef remove_whitespaces(text1):\n  return (re.sub(r'\\s+', '',text1))\nThe code uses `re.sub()` which is a function call, but there's no nesting of function calls here really. The `re.sub()` is just called and its result is returned.\n\nHowever, we could think of `return` as potentially being a \"function\" in the student's mind, but that's a stretch. The real issue is there aren't nested function calls in this solution.\n\nWait, let me think about this differently. If the student believes nested function calls are invoked outside-in, they would avoid writing nested calls. So if there was a solution that naturally used nested calls like `return re.sub(...)`, they might break it up.\n\nActually, the current solution doesn't have nested function calls. But we could imagine a version that does. For example, if we wanted to use `.strip()` or something, or if we wanted to call `str()` on the result, etc.\n\nBut more importantly, the student would AVOID nesting. So if the natural solution involves `return re.sub(...)`, the student might write:\nresult = re.sub(r'\\s+', '', text1)\nreturn result\nBut that's not really demonstrating the misconception strongly because that's just good readable code.\n\nLet me think... The student believes nested calls are invoked outside-in. So they would avoid writing:\n- `return func1(func2(x))`\n\nAnd instead write:\n- `temp = func2(x)`\n- `return func1(temp)`\n\nIn the given solution, we have `return (re.sub(r'\\s+', '',text1))`. \n\nI need to explore ways to expose the student's misconception about function call order. The current solution lacks clear nested function calls that would reveal their misunderstanding. Perhaps introducing a more complex scenario with multiple function transformations could highlight how they might incorrectly approach nested function calls.\n\nThe core issue is that this specific problem doesn't naturally demonstrate nested function behavior. While I initially considered creating an artificial example, the solution's simplicity makes it challenging to illustrate the misconception effectively. The `re.sub()` method doesn't inherently involve nested calls that would trigger the student's potential misunderstanding.\n\nUltimately, this particular problem seems unsuitable for exploring nested function call misconceptions. The solution is straightforward, with no complex function interactions that would reveal the student's potential misinterpretation of function call order.",
