Define variables inside the function\n2. NOT return them (or maybe not even call the function properly)\n3. Try to access those variables outside\n\nThe student genuinely believes this will work. So they might write something like:\n\n```py\ndef find_Max_Num(arr) : \n    n = len(arr)\n    arr.sort(reverse = True) \n    num = arr[0] \n    for i in range(1,n) : \n        num = num * 10 + arr[i]\n\nfind_Max_Num([3, 1, 4, 1, 5])\nresult = num  # Student thinks num is accessible here\nBut wait, the problem is to write a function, not necessarily to call it. Let me re-read.\n\nThe problem says \"Write a python function to find the largest number that can be formed with the given list of digits.\"\n\nSo the function should return the value. But a student with this misconception might not return it, thinking they can just access the variable outside.\n\nLet me make it more clear:\n\n```py\ndef find_Max_Num(arr) : \n    n = len(arr)\n    arr.sort(reverse = True) \n    num = arr[0] \n    for i in range(1,n) : \n        num = num * 10 + arr[i]\n    # Student doesn't return, thinks num is accessible outside\nI'll complete the partial thought by copying over the next thinking:\n        num = num * 10 + arr[i]\n    # Student doesn't return, thinks num is accessible outside\n\nThe core issue is the student's fundamental misunderstanding of variable scope. They incorrectly assume that local variables inside a function can be accessed globally, which is not how Python's function scoping works. This misconception leads to errors when trying to use variables defined within a function's local context.\n\nThe example demonstrates a critical programming mistake where the student attempts to access an internal function variable after the function call, resulting in a runtime NameError that highlights the importance of understanding variable scope and proper function design.",
