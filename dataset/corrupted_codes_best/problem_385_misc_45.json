A student with this misconception wouldn't change this because it's already being used directly in a context where it makes sense.\n\nThere's no clear place where:\n1. An object is created and a method is called on it without assigning to a variable first\n2. Constructor chaining or method chaining occurs\n\nThe misconception is about believing you MUST assign constructor invocations to variables before using them. But in this prime number code, there are no instances where an object is created and then immediately used without assignment - or where such a pattern would make sense.\n\nThis misconception is about object-oriented programming patterns, specifically about chaining method calls on newly created objects. The prime number problem is procedural and doesn't involve OOP patterns where this misconception would manifest.\n\nTherefore, this misconception is **inapplicable** to this problem.",
