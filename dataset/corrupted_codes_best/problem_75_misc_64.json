Looking through the code:\n- There's no arithmetic operations involving `-` and `/` together\n- The code mainly deals with pointer manipulation and comparisons\n\nSince the problem doesn't involve any expressions with both subtraction and division operators, this misconception is not applicable to this particular problem/solution.\n\nWait, let me think if I can modify the solution in a way that would naturally involve these operators. For example, if we were to implement a different approach or add some calculation... but that would be artificially forcing the misconception into a place where it doesn't naturally fit.\n\nThe misconception is specifically about the precedence of `-` vs `/`. If the code doesn't use these operators together in an expression, then the misconception cannot be demonstrated.\n\nThis seems like a case where the misconception is inapplicable to the given problem.",
