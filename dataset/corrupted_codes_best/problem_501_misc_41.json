In this problem, the condition `result == 'Heads'` is either true or false and doesn't change, so the student wouldn't see a difference in behavior.\n\nHowever, I need to think about how a student with this misconception might approach the problem differently. If they think if-statements work like loops, they might:\n\n1. Try to use an if-statement where they want something to happen repeatedly\n2. Not use a while loop when they should because they think if does the same thing\n3. Use an if-statement expecting it to loop until a condition changes\n\nIn this specific problem, the result doesn't change after being set, so an if-statement would behave the same as a while loop would (since the condition only evaluates once anyway). But the student might write code differently based on their misconception.\n\nWait, let me think more carefully. The student believes if-statements loop. In the coin_game function, the result is set once and never changes. So even if an if-statement looped, it would either loop forever (if result is 'Heads') or not execute at all.\n\nActually, this misconception might not naturally manifest in this particular problem because:\n1. The condition doesn't change within the scope\n2. The function returns immediately\n\nLet me think of a way the student might write this differently if they had this misconception...\n\nPerhaps the student might try to do something like keep flipping until they get a certain result? But that's not what the problem asks for.\n\n\nThe student might mistakenly believe the if-statement will repeatedly check and wait for a specific condition. They could write code that attempts to use an if-statement as a continuous checking mechanism, revealing their fundamental misunderstanding about how conditional statements actually work.\n\nThe core issue is the student's incorrect mental model of how if-statements function, thinking they can somehow maintain a persistent check or loop, when in reality they only execute once based on the initial condition.",
