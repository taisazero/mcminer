This means when they want to call a function, they would write `function_name` instead of `function_name()`.\n\nLooking at the given implementation, I need to find where this misconception could manifest. The code currently:\n1. Defines a function `dog_age(h_age)` - this part is fine, the definition doesn't change\n2. Uses `exit()` - this is a function call!\n3. Returns `d_age` - this is not a function call\n\nSo the student with this misconception would believe that to call the `exit()` function, they should write `exit` without parentheses.\n\nThe student genuinely believes this is correct - they think that's how you call functions in Python. So they would write:\n\n```py\ndef dog_age(h_age):\n if h_age < 0:\n \texit\n elif h_age <= 2:\n\t d_age = h_age * 10.5\n else:\n\t d_age = 21 + (h_age - 2)*4\n return d_age\nThis would be a harmful misconception because:\n1. `exit` without parentheses doesn't actually call the exit function\n2. It just references the function object\n3. The code would continue executing instead of exiting\n4. This could lead to undefined behavior (d_age might not be defined if h_age < 0 and we don't exit)\n\nActually, wait - if h_age < 0, and we don't exit, then we don't enter the elif or else blocks, so d_age is never defined, and then `return d_age` would cause a runtime error (NameError: name 'd_age' is not defined).\n\nSo this is a harmful misconception that would cause a runtime error when h_age < 0.\n\nThe error_type would be \"runtime\" because when h_age is negative, the code would fail at runtime with a NameError.",
