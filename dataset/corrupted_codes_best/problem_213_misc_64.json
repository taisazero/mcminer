In reality, division has higher precedence than subtraction in Python (and most programming languages).\n\n## Analyzing the Code\n\nLet me focus on the line that contains both `-` and `/`:\n\n```python\nd_age = 21 + h_age * 4 - 2 * 4 / 2\n```\n\nLet me trace through what happens with correct operator precedence:\n- Correct precedence: `*` and `/` before `+` and `-`\n- Evaluation: `21 + (h_age * 4) - ((2 * 4) / 2)`\n- Simplifies to: `21 + (h_age * 4) - (8 / 2)`\n- Further: `21 + (h_age * 4) - 4`\n- Result: `17 + h_age * 4`\n\nNow, if the student believed `-` has higher precedence than `/`:\n- They would expect: `21 + (h_age * 4) - (2 * 4) / 2`\n- Which would be: `21 + (h_age * 4) - 8 / 2`\n- Then: `(21 + h_age * 4 - 8) / 2`\n- This is NOT what they'd expect...\n\nLet me reconsider. If they believe `-` has higher precedence than `/`, they would expect:\n- `... - 2 * 4 / 2` to be evaluated as `(... - 2 * 4) / 2`\n\nBut wait, there's also `*` in there. Let me think about the specific part: `2 * 4 / 2`\n\nWith correct precedence (left-to-right for same precedence):\n- `2 * 4 / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4`\n\nThe expression `21 + h_age * 4 - 2 * 4 / 2` seems unnecessarily complex. Why write `2 * 4 / 2` when it just equals `4`? \n\nIf the student believed `-` has higher precedence than `/`, would they write this expression differently? Not necessarily in this case, because the `-` and `/` aren't directly adjacent in a way that would reveal the misconception clearly.\n\nThe key pattern to look for would be something like `a - b / c` where the student expects `(a - b) / c` but gets `a - (b / c)`.\n\nIn this code, we have `... - 2 * 4 / 2`. The multiplication happens first regardless, giving us `... - 8 / 2`. Then with correct precedence, it's `... - (8 / 2) = ... - 4`.\n\nThe expression `2 * 4 / 2` is oddly written and could suggest confusion, but it doesn't definitively show the misconception about `-` vs `/` precedence. It could just be inefficient code.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile the expression `2 * 4 / 2` is unnecessarily complex, it doesn't clearly demonstrate the specific misconception that `-` has higher precedence than `/`. The code would work the same way regardless of whether the student has this misconception or not in this particular case.\n\n<answer>\n<exhibits_misconception>N</exhibits_misconception>\n<confidence>medium</confidence>\n</answer>",
