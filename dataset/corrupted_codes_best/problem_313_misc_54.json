The misconception is specifically about arithmetic expressions and variables that change. The example shows:\n- Student thinks `y = x * 2` means y is always \"x * 2\" and updates when x changes\n- This is about dynamic binding/updating of values\n\nLooking at the given solution, it doesn't really involve:\n1. Multiple variables that change\n2. Arithmetic expressions\n3. Variables being reassigned and expecting other variables to update\n\nThe solution is a straightforward function that takes input, processes it with regex, and returns the result. There's no variable reassignment or arithmetic operations involved.\n\nThis misconception seems inapplicable to this particular problem because:\n- The problem doesn't involve arithmetic expressions\n- There are no variables that change and would expect other variables to update\n- The solution is a simple function call with regex substitution\n\nI should return NONE because this misconception doesn't naturally apply to this string manipulation problem.",
