This means when they want to call a function, they would just write the function name without `()`.\n\nIn the given code:\n```py\nimport re\ndef remove_whitespaces(text1):\n  return (re.sub(r'\\s+', '',text1))\nThe function uses `re.sub()` which is a function call. If the student believes functions are called without parentheses, they would write `re.sub` instead of `re.sub(...)`.\n\nHowever, this creates a problem - how would they pass the arguments? The student might believe that you pass arguments in some other way, or they might just not use parentheses at all.\n\nLooking at the example provided:\ndef get_value():\n    return 42\n\nresult = get_value  # Assigns the function object, not the return value\nprint(result)  # Prints: <function get_value at ...>\nThe student omits parentheses when calling `get_value`, which means they just reference the function object.\n\nFor the given problem, the student would likely write:\n```py\nimport re\ndef remove_whitespaces(text1):\n  return re.sub\nBut wait, this doesn't make sense because they need to pass arguments somehow. Let me reconsider...\n\nActually, the misconception is specifically about calling functions. When the student wants to call a function, they believe they don't need parentheses. But the function `re.sub` needs arguments. \n\nOne interpretation: The student might think they can just name the function without parentheses and somehow the arguments are understood, but that doesn't make practical sense.\n\nAnother interpretation: The student defines the function correctly but when calling it (if there's a call), they would omit parentheses. But in this case, we're defining a function, not calling it externally in the code.\n\nWait, inside the function, `re.sub(r'\\s+', '',text1)` IS a function call. So the student who believes functions are called without parentheses would write it without parentheses.\n\n\nThe student might assume arguments can be passed implicitly or through some alternative method. They could be confused about how function calls actually work, believing that simply writing the function name is sufficient to execute it with expected arguments. This misunderstanding suggests a fundamental gap in understanding function invocation and argument passing in Python.\n\nThe core issue is a critical misconception about function calls, where the student doesn't recognize the necessity of parentheses and explicit argument specification. This leads to code that fails silently, returning a function object instead of performing the intended operation.",
